      <span class="letra">T</span>HIS is not a history. It is not a guide-book.
      It is not an encyclopedia. It is nothing more ambitious than the title
      would indicate: a stroll about Washington with my arm through my reader’s,
      and a bit of friendly chat by the way. Mr. Hornby, sketch-book in hand,
      will accompany us, to give permanence to our impressions here and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, we will take a general look at the city and recall some of the more
      interesting incidents connected with its century and a quarter of growth.
      Next, we will walk at our leisure through its public places and try to
      people them in imagination with the figures which once were so much in
      evidence there.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the stories woven into our talk I make no further claim than that they
      have come to me from a variety of sources&mdash;personal observation,
      dinner-table gossip, old letters and diaries, and local tradition. A few,
      which seemed rather too vague in detail, I have tried to verify. My ardor
      for research, however, was dampened by the discovery of from two to a
      dozen versions of every occurrence, so that I have been driven to
      accepting those which appeared most probable or most picturesque, falling
      back upon the plea of the Last Minstrel:

    </h2>
    <p class="nind">
      <span class="letra">W</span>ITH the possible exception of Petrograd,
      Washington is the only one of the world’s great capitals that was
      deliberately created for its purpose. Look for the origin of London,
      Paris, Berlin, or Rome, and you find it enveloped in a cloud of myth and
      fable, from which, it appears, the city emerged and took its place in
      history because certain evolutionary forces had made it the nucleus of a
      nation and hence the natural seat of government. Not so the capital of the
      United States. Here the Government was already established and seeking a
      habitation; and, since no existing city offered one that seemed generally
      satisfactory, a new city was made to order, so that from the outset it
      could be shaped as its tenant-master deemed best.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creative force at work in this instance found its outlet through a
      dinner. Of the ready-made cities which had competed for the honor of
      housing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_002" id="page_002"></a>{2}</span>
      Government, New York and Philadelphia were regarded by the Southern
      members of Congress as too far north both geographically and in sentiment,
      while the Northern members were equally unwilling to go far south in view
      of the difficulties of travel. Another sectional controversy broke out
      over the question whether the Federal Government, since it owed its birth
      to the War for Independence, were not in honor bound to assume the debts
      incurred by the several States in prosecuting that war. The North, as the
      more serious sufferer, demanded that it should, but the South insisted
      that every State should bear its own burden. In the midst of the
      discussion, Thomas Jefferson, who happened to be in a position to act as
      mediator, invited a few leaders of both factions to meet at his table;
      there, under the influence of savory viands and a bottle of port apiece,
      they arranged a compromise, whereby the Southern members were to vote for
      the assumption of the debts, in exchange for Northern votes for a southern
      site. The program went through Congress by a small majority, and the site
      chosen was a tract about ten miles square on both banks of the Potomac
      River, the land on the upper shore being ceded by Maryland and that on the
      lower by Virginia. The Virginia part was given back in 1846.
    </p>
    <p>
      As far as we know, the first map of this region was<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_003" id="page_003"></a>{3}</span> drawn by Captain John Smith
      of Pocahontas fame and published in 1620 in his “Sixth Voyage to that Part
      of Virginia now Planted by English Colonies, whom God increase and
      preserve”; and the picturesque river which runs through it was described
      by him as the “Patawomeke, navigable 140 myles, and fed with many sweet
      rivers and springs which fall from the bordering hils. The river exceedth
      with aboundance of fish.”
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Commissioners appointed by President Washington took it over as a
      federal district, they changed its Indian name, Connogochegue, to the
      Territory of Columbia; and the city which they laid out in it was by
      universal acclaim called Washington, regardless of the modest protests of
      the statesman thus honored. Georgetown, which is now a part of Washington,
      was then a pretty, well-to-do, little Maryland town about a hundred years
      old, and Alexandria, Virginia, included in the southern end of the
      District as then bounded, was a shipping port of some consequence. All the
      rest of the tract was forest and farm land. The President felt a lively
      personal interest in the whole neighborhood. His estate, Mount Vernon, lay
      only a short boat-ride down the Potomac; and he had been instrumental in
      starting a project for the canal now known as the Chesapeake and Ohio,<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_004" id="page_004"></a>{4}</span> connecting
      Georgetown with a bit of farming country west of it, and had planned one
      from Alexandria which should form part of the same system. During his
      activities on the Maryland side of the river, he made his headquarters in
      a little stone house in Georgetown which is still standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took time and diplomacy to induce some of the local landholders to part
      with their acres to the Commissioners. There is an old story, good enough
      to be true, of one David Burns, a canny Scot, who held out so long that
      President Washington personally undertook his conversion. After pointing
      out to the farmer what advantages he would reap from having the Government
      for a neighbor, the great man concluded:
    </p>
    <p>
      “But for this opportunity, Mr. Burns, you might have died a poor
      tobacco-planter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Aye, mon,” snapped Burns, “an’ had ye no married the widder Custis, wi’
      all her nagurs, ye’d ha’ been a land surveyor the noo, an’ a mighty poor
      ane at that!”
    </p>
    <p>
      However, when he learned that, unless he accepted the liberal terms
      offered him, his land would be condemned and seized at an appraisal
      probably much lower, Burns met the President in quite another mood, and to
      the final question, “Well, sir, what have you concluded to do?” astonished
      every one by his prompt<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_005"
      id="page_005"></a>{5}</span> response: “Whate’er your excellency wad ha’
      me.” On one of his fields now stands the White House, and an adjacent lot
      became Lafayette Square. By the sale of property adjoining that which the
      Government bought, he amassed what for those days was an enormous fortune.
      It is within our generation that his cottage was torn down for the
      improvement of the neighborhood from which we enter Potomac Park. Although
      a poor building in its old age, in its prime it had sheltered many eminent
      men. Among them was Tom Moore, the Irish poet, who was under its roof when
      he wrote his diatribe against&mdash;

      Little as we may relish such satire, we are bound to admit its modicum of
      truthfulness, for the brave souls who founded Washington were given to the
      grandiloquent habit of their day. They had called to their aid Major
      Pierre Charles L’Enfant, a French military engineer who had served in the
      patriot army of the Revolution, and who cherished brilliant dreams of the
      future of his adopted country. To him they had committed the preparation
      of a plan for the federal city, and he had laid it out on the lines, not
      of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_006" id="page_006"></a>{6}</span>
      administrative center for a handful of newly enfranchised colonies, but of
      a capital for a republic of fifty States with five hundred million
      population. As he had lived in Versailles, he is supposed to have taken
      that town as a general model in his arrangement of streets and avenues,
      which some one has likened to “a wheel laid on a gridiron.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, it was the business of the Commissioners to advertise the
      attractions of the federal city as effectively as possible, to promote its
      early settlement; so perhaps we may forgive their taking a good deal for
      granted, and permitting real estate speculation to go practically
      unchecked. Congress for several years ignored their appeals for an
      appropriation for the development of the city, and in the interval their
      chief dependence for the funds necessary to spend for highways and
      buildings was on the sale of lots, and on grants or loans obtained from
      neighboring States. The most sightly hill was set apart for the Capitol,
      and a beautiful bit of rising ground, overlooking a bend in the river, for
      the President’s House. The two buildings had their corner-stones laid with
      much ceremony, but progress on them was slow. Nevertheless, their sites,
      as well as the spaces reserved in L’Enfant’s plan for parks, fountains,
      and statuary, were always treated by the speculators, in correspondence
      with prospective<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_007" id="page_007"></a>{7}</span>
      customers, as if the improvements designed eventually to crown them were
      already installed. The outside public manifested no undue eagerness to
      buy, and the auction sales of lots proved very disappointing. Then a
      lottery was organized, with tickets at seven dollars apiece, and for a
      first prize “a superb hotel” with baths and other comforts, worth fifty
      thousand dollars; but that, too, fell short of expectations, all the
      desirable prizes going to persons who felt no concern for the city’s
      future, and the hotel, though started, never being finished. It was a
      pretty discouraging prospect, therefore, which confronted the officers of
      the Government when, on May 16, 1800, President John Adams issued his
      order for their removal from their cozy quarters in old Philadelphia to
      what seemed to them, by contrast, like a camp in the wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The six Cabinet members, with their one hundred and thirty-two
      subordinates, made the journey overland at various dates during the
      summer, and in October the archives followed. These filled about a dozen
      large boxes, which, with the office furniture, were brought down by sea in
      a packet-boat and landed on a wharf at the mouth of Tiber Creek, a
      tributary of the Potomac which then ran through the city but was later
      converted into a sewer. All Washington, numbering perhaps three thousand
      persons, turned out<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_008" id="page_008"></a>{8}</span>
      to greet the vessel; and amid cheers, ringing of bells, and blasts from an
      antique cannon brought forth for the occasion, its precious contents were
      carried ashore. “The Department buildings” to which they were consigned
      were a wonderful assortment. The Treasury was a two-story brick house at
      the southeast corner of the President’s grounds, the War Office a still
      unfinished replica of it at the southwest corner. The Post-office
      Department found shelter in a private house in which only half the floors
      were laid and four rooms plastered; while the Secretary of State, the
      Secretary of the Navy, and the Attorney-general had to direct their
      affairs from their lodgings. All these temporary accommodations were
      sought as near as possible to the President’s House. Congress had striven,
      for its greater ease of access, to have the Departments quartered near the
      Capitol; but Washington had set his face resolutely against every such
      proposal, citing the experience of his own secretaries, who had been so
      pestered with needless visits from Senators and Representatives that some
      of them “had been obliged to go home and deny themselves, in order to
      transact current business.” Which shows that one modern nuisance has a
      fairly ancient precedent.

      find most of the best rooms in the two or three hotels and the little
      cluster of boarding-houses already occupied by the executive functionaries
      and their families. President Adams, who had preceded them by a few weeks,
      was not much better off even in the official abode reserved for him, if we
      may call his wife as a witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The house is on a grand and superb scale,” she wrote to her daughter,
      “requiring about thirty servants to attend and keep the apartments in
      proper order, and perform the ordinary business of the house and stables.
      The lighting the apartments, from the kitchen to the parlor and chambers,
      is a tax indeed; and the fires we are obliged to keep, to secure us from
      daily agues, is another very cheering comfort. Bells are wholly wanting,
      not one single one being hung through the whole house, and promises are
      all you can obtain. I could content myself almost anywhere three months;
      but surrounded by forests, can you believe that wood is not to be had,
      because people cannot be found to cut and cart it! There is not a single
      apartment finished. We have not the least fence or yard, or other
      convenience without; and the great unfinished audience-room I make a
      drying-room of, to hang up the clothes in. The principal stairs are not
      up, and will not be this winter. The ladies are impatient<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a>{10}</span> for a
      drawing-room; I have no looking-glasses but dwarfs for this house, not a
      twentieth part lamps enough to light it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Adams’s consolatory reflection that she would have to endure these
      conditions only three months, was probably shared by many of the
      thirty-two Senators and one hundred and five Representatives who, on the
      high hill to the east, shivered and shook and passed unflattering
      criticisms on everybody who had had a hand in the construction of the
      Capitol. Only the old north wing was in condition for use, and not all of
      that. The Senate met in what is now the Supreme Court chamber; the House
      took its chances wherever there was room, ending its travels in an
      uncomfortable box of a hall commonly styled “the oven.” Most of the
      members had made some study of the L’Enfant chart before coming to
      Washington. One of them put into writing his impressions as he looked
      about and tried to identify the public improvements he had been led to
      expect. None of the streets was recognizable, he said, with the possible
      exception of a road having two buildings on each side of it, which was
      called New Jersey Avenue. The “magnificent Pennsylvania Avenue,”
      connecting the Capitol with the President’s House, was for nearly the
      entire distance a deep morass covered with wild bushes,<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_011" id="page_011"></a>{11}</span> through
      which a passage had been hewn. The roads in every direction were muddy and
      unimproved. The only attempt at a sidewalk had been made with chips of
      stone left from building the Capitol, and this was little used because the
      sharp edges cut the walker’s shoes in dry weather, and in wet weather
      covered them with white mortar. Another member declared that there was
      nothing in sight in Washington but scrub oak, and that, since there was
      “only one good tavern within a day’s march,” many members had to live in
      Georgetown and drive to and from the daily sessions of Congress in a
      rickety coach. And a particularly disgusted critic, not content with
      recording that “there are but few houses in any place, and most of them
      are small, miserable huts,” added: “The people are poor, and, as far as I
      can judge, live like fishes, by eating each other.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Newspapers in all parts of the country echoed these depressing reports,
      accompanying them with demands that the Government move again, this time
      to some already well-populated and civilized region. Indeed, of several
      resolutions to that end introduced in Congress, one was actually carried
      to a vote and barely escaped passage. It may have been this accumulation
      of discouraging elements which caused the delay in the arrival of the
      Supreme Court from Philadelphia; or<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_012"
      id="page_012"></a>{12}</span> it may have been the paucity of business
      before that tribunal, whose first Chief Justice, John Jay, had resigned
      his commission to become Governor of New York, because he had come to the
      conclusion that the Court could not command sufficient support in the
      country at large to enforce its decisions! Whatever the reason, the
      Justices did not find their way to Washington till well on in the winter,
      or open their work there till February. They were assigned the room in the
      basement of the Capitol now occupied by the Supreme Court library.

      Even when the first acute discomforts incident to removal had passed away,
      the general depression was little relieved. Most of the earlier citizens
      of Washington had entertained hopes of its becoming a commercial as well
      as a political center of importance. They reasoned that since Alexandria
      and Georgetown had already built up some trade with the outside world,
      Washington, much more eligibly situated than either, ought to attract a
      correspondingly larger measure of profitable business. But all these
      bright anticipations were doomed to disappointment: the progress of the
      city was as inconsiderable as if its feet had become mired in one of its
      own marshes. The Mall, which on L’Enfant’s map appeared as a boulevard
      fringed with fine public buildings, soon degenerated<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_013" id="page_013"></a>{13}</span> into a common for pasturing
      cows. There was good fishing above the north side of Pennsylvania Avenue
      from Sixth Street to Thirteenth. Wild ducks found a favorite haunt where
      the Center Market now stands. The whole place wore an air of suspended
      vitality in striking contrast with the generous face of nature. “I am,”
      wrote a visiting New Yorker to his wife, “almost enchanted with it&mdash;I
      mean the situation for a city, for there is nothing here yet constituting
      one. As to houses, there are very few, and those very scattering; and as
      to streets, there are none, except you would call common roads streets.
      The site, however, for a city, is the most delightful that can be imagined&mdash;far
      beyond my expectation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I took a hack after dinner to visit Nath’l Maxwell, and although he lives
      near the center of the great city, yet such was the state of the roads
      that I considered my life in danger. The distance on straight lines does
      not exceed half a mile, but I had to ride up and down very steep hills,
      with frightful gullies on almost every side.” And the simplicity of life
      at the capital then is reflected in his statement that after finishing his
      letters one night he was afraid to go out to post them lest he lose his
      way in the dark, though he knew that the mail would close at five in the
      morning. “After I had got comfortably into bed,” he continued, “a watchman<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_014" id="page_014"></a>{14}</span> came past
      my window bawling out, ‘Past one o’clock, and a very stormy night,’ on
      which I sprang out of bed and called to him to take my letters to the
      post-office, which he consented to do. I accordingly wrapped them in a
      sheet of paper to protect them from the wet, and threw them out of the
      chamber window to him.”

      The declaration of war against Great Britain in June, 1812, for which the
      country at large held President Madison chiefly responsible, and which
      reduced considerably such measure of popularity as he still retained, did
      not produce much effect on the pulses of the stagnant city. The first
      hostilities occurred in the north and on the sea; and, although the enemy
      threatened Washington for more than a year, Madison and most of his
      advisers regarded an attack as highly improbable. When, however, it became
      known in 1814 that a large body of Wellington’s veterans were setting sail
      from England, under convoy of a powerful fleet, for the mouth of
      Chesapeake Bay, every one suddenly awoke to the impending peril. It was
      then too late. Thanks to the misjudgment of General Armstrong, Secretary
      of War, or General Winder, who was in charge of military affairs in the
      District, midsummer found the enemy in Maryland, but the city still
      without an efficient defensive force, or ammunition or provisions<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_015" id="page_015"></a>{15}</span> to equip
      one properly. Hurried efforts brought together a first line of thirty-one
      hundred men, all raw recruits except six hundred sailors and a couple of
      hundred soldiers. A second line, almost equal in number, was formed,
      mostly of militia, and disposed for use as a home guard. At Bladensburg,
      Maryland, five miles north of Washington, the decisive battle occurred on
      the twenty-fourth of August, from which the seamen led by Captain Joshua
      Barney were the only contingent that emerged with extraordinary credit;
      but they did so well that a grateful community has not yet raised a
      monument to them or their leader. The battlefield was close enough to the
      old George Washington tavern, of which Mr. Hornby gives us an intimate
      glimpse, for the occupants to hear the rattle of musketry and see the
      cannon-smoke from the upper windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outcome of the fight was that the British commanders, General Ross and
      Admiral Cockburn, with six thousand men, drove the Americans back and
      swept down upon the city, spreading ruin in their track. Ross had his
      horse killed under him by a shot from a private house he was passing and
      kept more in the background thereafter, but Cockburn was active in the
      work of devastation. Tradition describes him as mounting the Speaker’s
      dais in the Hall of Representatives,<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_016" id="page_016"></a>{16}</span> calling a burlesque session
      of Congress to order, and putting the question: “Shall this harbor of
      Yankee democracy be burned? All in favor will say, ‘Aye’!” There was a
      roar of “Ayes” from the men, who at once set going a mammoth bonfire of
      written records and volumes from the library of Congress, and soon the
      whole Capitol was wrapped in flames. Thence the party proceeded to the
      other public buildings, burning whatever was recognizable as the property
      of the Government. Their progress was nearly everywhere unopposed, the
      clerks in charge having gathered up such books and papers as they could
      carry away, and transported them to the most convenient hiding-places.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first break in this program occurred at the Patent Office, which was
      under the superintendency of Doctor William Thornton, himself of English
      birth. A neighbor having warned him at his home that his office was in
      danger, he mounted his horse and galloped to the spot, where he arrived
      just in time to see a squad of soldiers training a field-piece upon the
      building. Leaping from the saddle and dramatically covering the muzzle of
      the gun with his body, he reminded the artillerists that the inventions
      they purposed destroying were monuments of human progress which belonged
      to the whole civilized world, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_017"
      id="page_017"></a>{17}</span> denounced such vandalism as a disgrace to
      the British uniform. His boldness had its effect, and the Patent Office
      was spared. Another check came, in the form of an accident of poetic
      justice, at Greenleaf’s Point, the present site of the Army War College.
      This place had been used as an arsenal by the defenders of the city, who,
      before deserting it, had secreted all their surplus gunpowder in a dry
      well in the midst of the grounds. A body of British troops undertook to
      destroy the American cannon they found there by firing one gun directly
      into another, when a fragment of burning wadding was blown into the well,
      causing an explosion that killed twelve and wounded more than thirty of
      the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      President Madison, who had been at Bladensburg personally superintending
      the placing of our troops, hastened southward when the rout began, and
      took refuge among the hills of northern Virginia. There he was presently
      joined by his wife, and both remained in seclusion till they received word
      that the British had marched away. This message was preceded by the news
      that the President’s House had been burned, with all its contents except a
      few portable articles which could be gathered and put out of harm’s reach
      at an hour’s notice. The property destroyed with absolute wantonness in
      various parts of the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_018"
      id="page_018"></a>{18}</span> aggregated in value between two and three
      million dollars&mdash;a heavy loss for a government which was just
      managing to stagger along with its legitimate burdens, and in a capital
      that could barely be kept from collapse under the most favoring
      conditions. It is not wonderful that the British press was almost a unit
      in condemning Cockburn’s vandalism, the London <i>Statesman</i> saying:
      “Willingly would we throw a veil of oblivion over the transactions at
      Washington; the Cossacks spared Paris, but we spared not the capital of
      America!” And the <i>Annual Register</i>: “The extent of the devastation
      practised by the victors brought a heavy censure upon the British
      character, not only in America, but on the Continent of Europe.” The
      restoration of the President’s House alone, including the repainting of
      its outside surface to remove the scars of the fire, consumed four years,
      in the course of which President Madison made way for his successor,
      Monroe, and the building had fastened to it, from its freshened color, the
      title it has worn in popular speech from that day to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sorry-looking Washington to which the Madisons came back.
      Blackened ruins were everywhere; placards posted here and there denounced
      the President as the author of the city’s misfortunes; mournful streams of
      women, children, old men, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_019"

      shamefaced stragglers from the defensive force, trickled in from the woods
      in the suburban country where they had been hiding since the battle; the
      streets were strewn with the wreckage of a cyclone which had swept the
      valley almost simultaneously with the hostile troops, unroofing houses,
      uprooting trees, demolishing chimneys, and generally supplementing the
      disasters of warfare. Indeed, almost the only potentiality of evil that
      had not come to pass was an uprising of the slaves, which had been widely
      feared, as some of the restless spirits among them had been overheard
      counseling their fellows to join the British in looting the city and then
      make a break for freedom. The Madisons, after a brief visit with friends,
      rented the Octagon house at the corner of New York Avenue and Eighteenth
      Street, now the headquarters of the American Institute of Architects. It
      was here that President Madison signed the treaty of Ghent, binding Great
      Britain and the United States to a peace which has remained for a whole
      century unbroken. Here, too, Dolly Madison held her republican court, the
      most famous since Martha Washington’s in New York, and far eclipsing that
      in splendor.
    </p>
    <p>
      To provide a meeting-place for Congress till the Capitol could be occupied
      once more, a building which stood at the corner of F and Seventh Streets
      was made<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_020" id="page_020"></a>{20}</span>
      over for the purpose. It proved so uncomfortable, however, as to revive
      with increased zest the discussion whether, in view of the spread of
      population through the newly opened West, it would not be wiser to remove
      the seat of government to some fairly accessible point in that part of the
      country. The agitation alarmed the more important property-owners in
      Washington, who, in order to head it off before it had gone too far,
      hastily organized a company to put up a temporary but better equipped
      substitute for the Capitol. They chose a site a few hundred yards to the
      eastward of the burned edifice, and there built a long house which is
      still standing, though now divided into dwellings. The stratagem
      accomplished its aim, and Congress stayed in its improvised domicile till
      1819. This occupancy gave the building the title, “the Old Capitol,” that
      clings to it to-day in spite of the changes it has undergone in the
      interval.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington was early supplied with a good general newspaper in the <i>National
      Intelligencer</i>, and the social side of life presently found a weekly
      interpreter in <i>The Huntress</i>, edited by Mrs. Ann Royall, whose
      personality was so aggressive that John Quincy Adams described her as
      going about “like a virago-errant in enchanted armor.” She said so much,
      also, in disparagement of some of her neighbors, that she was<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_021" id="page_021"></a>{21}</span> indicted
      by the grand jury as a common scold and threatened with a ducking in
      accordance with an old English law in force in the District. But the
      disseminators of information to whose coming the citizens looked forward
      more eagerly than to any printed sheet, were two men who made their rounds
      daily on horseback among the homes of the well-to-do. One was the postman,
      delivering the mails that came in by stage-coach from the outer world; the
      other was the barber, who, like an endless-chain letter, picked up the
      latest gossip at every house he visited, and left in exchange all the
      items he had picked up at previous stopping-places.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the next generation Washington saw, it is safe to say, more of the
      ups and downs of fortune than any other American city. The reasons were
      manifold. For one thing, the larger part of its population consisted of
      persons whose permanent ties were elsewhere. As federal officeholders they
      were residents of Washington, but they retained their citizenship in the
      places from which they had been drawn. Under the Constitution, moreover,
      Congress exercised supreme authority in the District of Columbia, and
      every member of Congress had the interests of his home constituency more
      at heart than those of the people who were his neighbors for only a few
      months<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_022" id="page_022"></a>{22}</span>
      at a time. Nevertheless, the population of the capital, which, when it
      rose from its ashes, numbered between eight and nine thousand, more than
      doubled within the next twenty years. Then came ten years of great
      uncertainty, during which occurred the overwhelming business panic of
      1837, that set awry nearly everything in America, and for this period the
      increase averaged only about five hundred souls annually. But another
      twenty years of forward movement brought the total up to a little more
      than sixty thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime many things had happened, calculated to attract public
      attention generally to Washington. President Monroe had proclaimed his
      famous doctrine, warning Europe to keep its hands off this hemisphere.
      President Jackson had made his fight upon the United States Bank and won
      it, changing the whole financial outlook of the country. The Capitol had
      been enlarged, and several new Government buildings started; the
      Smithsonian Institution had begun to make its mark in the scientific
      world, and the Washington Monument had risen nearly two hundred feet into
      the air. The long-threatened war with Mexico had come and gone, adding a
      rich area to our public domain. Steamships had crowded sailing vessels off
      the highways of commerce and become the main dependence of the Yankee
      navy. The Baltimore<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_023" id="page_023"></a>{23}</span>
      and Ohio Railway, the first successful experiment in its field, had
      brought what we now call the Middle West, with its grain and minerals, to
      within a day’s journey of the capital, and this pioneer enterprise had
      been followed by the opening of other rail facilities. The Fugitive Slave
      Law and the Kansas-Nebraska Act had been passed, slavery had been
      abolished in the District of Columbia, the Underground Railroad had begun
      to haul its daily consignment of runaway negroes across the Canada border,
      the Supreme Court had rendered the Dred Scott decision, and John Brown had
      led his raid in the mountain country scarcely fifty miles from where the
      Court was sitting. Letter postage, anywhere east of the Mississippi River,
      had come down to a three-cent unit. The first telegraph message had been
      transmitted over a wire connecting Baltimore with Washington, and out of
      this small beginning had presently been developed a network of electric
      communication covering all our more thickly populated territory; while
      experimenters with a submarine line had effected an exchange of messages
      between England and the United States which proved the practicability of
      their enterprise. Last but not least, royalty had smiled upon us in the
      person of the Prince of Wales, who had passed some days as the guest of
      President Buchanan at the White House.<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_024" id="page_024"></a>{24}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Washington been situated elsewhere than on the border line between two
      sections, neither of which felt any pride in its success, or had it been
      governed by executives whose records were to be made or marred by the
      faithfulness with which they turned every opportunity to account for its
      welfare and reputation, we should probably have seen the capital beginning
      then its career as the model city of the new world. Instead, the
      dependence of its people, at every stage, on the favor of what was
      practically an alien governing body, bore natural fruit in a feeble
      community spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      By 1860 Washington had reached the middle of its Slough of Despond. Not a
      street was paved except for a patch here and there, and Pennsylvania
      Avenue was the only one lighted after nightfall. Pigs roamed through the
      less pretentious highways as freely as dogs. There was not a sewer
      anywhere, a shallow, uncovered stream carrying off the common refuse to
      the Potomac, which was held in its channel only by raw earthen bluffs.
      Wells and springs furnished all the water, and the police and fire
      departments were those of a village. The open squares, intended for beauty
      spots, were densely overgrown with weeds. Except for an omnibus line to
      Georgetown, not a public conveyance was running. Such permanent Department
      buildings as had been started, though ambitious<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_025" id="page_025"></a>{25}</span> in design and suggesting by
      their outlines a desire for something better than had yet been
      accomplished, had not reached a habitable state. The Capitol was in
      disorder, and still overrun with workmen who had been employed in
      constructing the new wings and were preparing to raise the dome; the White
      House had scarcely a fitter look, with its environment of stables and
      shambling fences and its unkempt grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was there any prospect of speedy improvement in municipal conditions.
      Every considerable stride in that direction would mean largely increased
      taxation, and the bulk of the taxable property had drifted into the hands
      of unprogressive whites and ignorant negroes, who were equally unwilling
      to pay the price. Upon this seemingly hopeless chaos descended the cloud
      of civil war.
    </p>
    <p>

      <span class="letra">T</span>HREE days after John Brown had been hanged for
      his Harper’s Ferry raid, the Thirty-sixth Congress convened. Brown’s
      exploit had sent a wave of excitement sweeping over the country, and the
      slavery controversy had entered a phase of emotional acuteness it had
      never known before. There was a strong Republican plurality in the new
      House of Representatives, but it was by no means of one mind, most of its
      members still hoping to avoid any action which might precipitate a
      dismemberment of the Union. It took forty-four ballots, covering a period
      of eight weeks, for a combination of Republicans with a few outsiders to
      choose a Speaker, and the wrangling which preceded and followed the choice
      reached at times the verge of bloodshed. A large majority of the
      Representatives from both Northern and Southern constituencies attended
      the sessions armed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the end of June, 1860, four Presidential tickets were in the field.
      The Republican ticket was headed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_027"
      id="page_027"></a>{27}</span> by Abraham Lincoln of Illinois, the Northern
      Democratic ticket by his old rival in State politics, Stephen A. Douglas.
      The Southern Democrats had nominated John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky,
      then Vice-president, and what was left of the Whig party had united with
      the peacemakers generally in naming John Bell of Tennessee. When Lincoln
      was elected in November, every one knew that a crisis was at hand; for,
      although opposed to the use of violence for the extinction of slavery, he
      disbelieved utterly in the system, and the radical leaders in the South
      proceeded at once with their plans for divorcing the slave States from the
      free States.

      South Carolina led the actual revolt by adopting an ordinance of secession
      and withdrawing her delegation from Congress. Almost simultaneously she
      sent three commissioners to Washington, “empowered to treat with the
      Government of the United States for the delivery of the forts, magazines,
      lighthouses and other real estate within the limits of South Carolina” to
      the State authorities. President Buchanan, fearing lest any discussion
      with them might be construed as a recognition of their claim to an
      ambassadorial status, referred them to Congress, which met the difficulty
      at the threshold by turning their case over to a special committee, with
      the result that their demands<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_028"
      id="page_028"></a>{28}</span> were disregarded. The committee, however,
      played a pretty important part in the activities of the succeeding winter,
      for the Union men in its membership organized themselves into a sort of
      subcommittee of safety, and opened confidential channels of communication
      with men and women all over the city who were in a position to tell them
      promptly what the enemies of the Union were planning to do. These secret
      informers included all classes of persons, from domestic servants to
      Cabinet officers. The correspondence was conducted not through the
      post-office, but by cipher notes hidden in out-of-the-way places, where
      the parties for whom they were intended could safely look for them after
      nightfall.

      The militia and fire departments of the District of Columbia were modest
      affairs then, but their members were alert to the growing possibilities of
      trouble. Some who were secession sympathizers formed themselves into rifle
      clubs and drilled privately at night; while the Unionists built up a
      little body of minutemen, who elected their own officers and secreted
      stands of arms at the Capitol and other convenient points, so that they
      could respond instantly, wherever they chanced to be, to a summons for
      emergency service. Day after day brought its budget of news from the
      South, saddening or thrilling. Thomas and Floyd<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_029" id="page_029"></a>{29}</span> quitted the Cabinet, Dix
      became Secretary of the Treasury, and Holt Secretary of War. In January,
      1861, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi seceded,
      seizing all the forts, vessels, and other Government property on which
      they could lay hands; and Dix put upon the wire his historic despatch to
      his special agent at New Orleans, “If any one attempts to haul down the
      American flag, shoot him on the spot,” but it was intercepted and never
      reached its destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      February witnessed the secession of Texas, the election of Jefferson Davis
      as President and Alexander H. Stephens as Vice-president of the
      Confederate States of America, and the withdrawal of several Senators and
      Representatives from the United States Congress. The only cheering news of
      the month was the refusal of Tennessee and Missouri to secede, though both
      States contained a multitude of citizens who would have preferred to do
      so. Daily the galleries of Congress were crowded with spectators
      representing all shades of opinion and at times uncontrollable in their
      expressions of approval or disapproval. When the House voted to submit a
      Constitutional amendment forbidding the interference of Congress with
      slavery or any other State institution, one element in the gallery burst
      into deafening applause; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_030"
      id="page_030"></a>{30}</span> opposing element in the Senate became
      equally boisterous in applauding a speech by Andrew Johnson, denouncing as
      a traitor any man who should fire upon the flag or conspire to take over
      Government property for the Confederacy. The difference in the treatment
      of the two outbreaks was significant: that in the House was merely rebuked
      in words, but in the Senate the gallery was cleared and closed to
      spectators for the rest of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fairness it should be said that at this trying juncture several men in
      positions of responsibility, who had made no secret of their interest in
      the Southern cause, acted the honorable part when put to the test.
      Vice-president Breckinridge was credited by current gossip with an
      intention, at the official count of the electoral vote, to refuse to
      declare Lincoln elected, or permit a mob to break up the session and
      destroy the authenticated returns. On the contrary, he conducted the count
      with as much scrupulousness in every detail as if his heart were in the
      result. Equal praise is due to the chief of the Capitol police, who,
      though bitterly hostile to Mr. Lincoln, took all the precautions for his
      safety on the day of inauguration that his best friend could have taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the Buchanan administration went out, and the Lincoln administration
      came in. The persistent<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_031"

    <p class="nind">
      warnings of a plot to kill or kidnap the President-elect led to the
      adoption of an extraordinary program for bringing him safely to
      Washington. Under the escort of an experienced detective, he made the
      journey from Harrisburg at high speed, in a special train provided by the
      Pennsylvania Railroad Company, all the tracks having been previously
      cleared, and the telegraph wires cut along the route. Meanwhile, a
      sensational newspaper had published locally a story that Lincoln was
      already in the city, having been smuggled through Baltimore in disguise in
      order to elude the conspirators who were waiting there to assassinate him.
      This fiction so incensed William H. Seward, who had been in Washington
      preparing for the arrival of his future chief, that Lincoln was not
      allowed to make a toilet after his night’s journey, but was hurried, all
      unwashed and unshaven, to the Capitol, so that the members of Congress
      could see him and satisfy themselves of the falsity of what they had read.
    </p>
    <p>
      His immunity thus far did not quiet the apprehensions of Lincoln’s
      friends, who took especial pains to prevent the interruption of his
      inauguration at any point. A temporary fence was built around the space
      immediately in front of the platform from which his address was to be
      delivered, and an enclosed alley of boards was constructed from the place
      where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_032" id="page_032"></a>{32}</span>
      would leave his carriage to the place where he would pass into the
      Capitol. On the morning of the fourth of March, armed men in citizen’s
      clothing were stationed on the roofs of all the buildings overlooking the
      main east portico, and others on and under its platform, while yet others
      mingled with the crowd of thirty thousand spectators that early assembled
      on the plaza. Batteries of light artillery were posted in commanding
      positions, with their cannon loaded and prepared to sweep any of several
      converging streets on the approach of a mob. Buchanan drove with Lincoln
      to the Capitol, and their carriage was surrounded by a hollow square of
      regular troops, in formation so dense that the occupants of the vehicle
      were scarcely visible from the sidewalk. Hannibal Hamlin, the
      Vice-president-elect, walked up from Willard’s Hotel, on purpose to hear
      what the people who lined the Avenue were saying. Their comments were, as
      a rule, far from friendly to the incoming administration, and some were
      distinctly ominous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln appeared very calm, in spite of the general atmosphere of
      excitement. Buchanan’s face was graver than usual, and he spoke little
      during the drive. When the party came upon the platform, Senator Baker of
      Oregon stepped forward and said simply, “Fellow citizens, I introduce to
      you Abraham Lincoln,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_033" id="page_033"></a>{33}</span>
      President-elect of the United States”; and the tall, ungainly hero of the
      day advanced to the rail. He laid his manuscript, to which he had put the
      finishing touches at daybreak that morning, upon the little desk with his
      cane for a paper-weight, and looked about for somewhere to lay his high
      silk hat; Stephen A. Douglas, who was sitting near, reached for the hat
      and held it throughout the proceedings. Lincoln, after a brief pause, drew
      from his pocket a pair of steel-bowed spectacles, which he adjusted very
      deliberately, and began to read with a seriousness of manner that soon
      quenched all disposition to frivolity in his audience. The address was a
      plea for the preservation of that friendship between the North and the
      South which had been hallowed by their united warfare in the past against
      the enemies of their country, and ended thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of
      affection. The mystic cords of memory, stretching from every battlefield
      and patriot grave to every loving heart and hearthstone all over this
      broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as
      surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.”
    </p>
    <p>
      When the last syllable had passed his lips, he stood still a moment,
      slowly sweeping the multitude with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_034"
      id="page_034"></a>{34}</span> his eyes. Then he bowed to Chief Justice
      Taney, who, in a voice tremulous with emotion, administered the oath of
      office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within six weeks thereafter Fort Sumter had been fired upon, and the new
      President had issued his call for seventy-five thousand volunteers to
      maintain the laws of the United States, and summoned Congress to meet in
      extra session on the fourth of July. Almost the first thing the Senate did
      when it came together was to expel six of its members who had cast their
      fortunes with the seceding States. Meanwhile, Washington had been
      transformed from an outwardly peaceful town into a military camp. A home
      defense corps was hurriedly enlisted by Cassius M. Clay of Kentucky and
      James H. Lane of Kansas, and a guard was posted around the White House
      every night. The minutemen were called out repeatedly for special service.
      Once they seized a vessel which was about to sail from a Potomac wharf for
      a southern port, laden with munitions of war alleged to have been stolen
      from the Government. Again, they marched to Georgetown and took forcible
      possession of the flour stored in a mill there and reported to them as
      destined for the Confederate army; this, by commandeering all the wagons
      in the neighborhood, they removed to the Capitol and stowed away in the
      basement rooms. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_035" id="page_035"></a>{35}</span>
      the streets, all strangers were eyed with suspicion. Signals to the
      police, the home defense corps, and the minutemen were conveyed by certain
      tollings of big bells; and, as every signal meant trouble either present
      or imminent, the townspeople lived continually as if on the brink of a
      volcano.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the earliest State volunteers to reach the city were regiments from
      Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania. The Massachusetts Sixth, which
      had been fired on by a mob while passing through Baltimore, was quartered
      in the Hall of the Senate, and the New York Seventh in the Hall of
      Representatives; while bivouacked in other parts of the same building were
      about five hundred Pennsylvanians and a company of United States
      artillery, for there was general expectation of a Confederate attack upon
      the Capitol. The New York Seventy-first was assigned to the Washington
      Navy Yard, so as to be convenient for repelling approaches from Alexandria
      by way of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first incident of the war in which Alexandria figured, however, was
      not a foray on Washington but a tragedy at home. Colonel Ephraim E.
      Ellsworth, who had recruited a regiment of zouaves from New York City,
      came to Washington at its head. He was young, handsome, soldierly in
      bearing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_036" id="page_036"></a>{36}</span>
      full of enthusiasm; but Mr. Lincoln, though greatly attracted to him, felt
      some misgivings as to his ability to control his zouaves, for the New York
      firemen of that period had a reputation for turbulence. Hence, when
      arrangements were made for moving troops into Virginia to occupy a region
      which must be held for the defense of the capital, the President consented
      to let Ellsworth’s regiment go only on condition that it should be
      instantly disbanded if its members committed any breach of discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
      At two o’clock on the morning of May 24, 1861, the zouaves boarded two
      Potomac steamboats, which before sunrise had dropped down to Alexandria.
      Leaving most of his men on the wharf, Ellsworth started with a small squad
      toward a telegraph office whence he could report to Washington by wire. He
      observed a Confederate flag flying from the roof of a hotel known as the
      Marshall House, and, realizing what might happen if his men caught sight
      of it, entered with the purpose of directing its removal. Jackson, the
      landlord, was abed, and the man in charge of the office seemed
      irresponsible, so Ellsworth and his squad hauled down the flag themselves.
      As they were descending with it, Jackson suddenly emerged from his chamber
      in the second story and leveled a double-barreled shotgun at Corporal
      Brownell, the soldier<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_037" id="page_037"></a>{37}</span>
      nearest him. Brownell, with his rifle, struck Jackson’s gun just as its
      trigger was pulled, and the shot went wild; but in an instant Jackson had
      aimed again and discharged the contents of the second barrel into
      Ellsworth’s breast. The Colonel fell dead, and Brownell, firing and using
      his bayonet almost simultaneously, killed Jackson where he stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except one who had lost his life by an accident, Ellsworth was the first
      Union soldier to fall in the Civil War. He was buried from the White House
      by the President’s order; and the news of his death so aroused the North
      that volunteers poured into Washington for a time faster than the
      Government could arm and provision them. Mostly they were militia
      regiments which had come on under their own officers. In Washington they
      were united in brigades, with generals of some experience in command, and
      sent into Virginia by way of the “Long Bridge,” which had its terminus on
      the fringe of the Arlington estate; it was a wooden structure, and the
      troops had to break step in crossing it. The first battle between the two
      armies was at a point near Manassas, and took its name, Bull Run, from a
      small stream which, about twenty-five miles southwest of Washington, joins
      the Occoquan River.
    </p>
    <p>
      So little conception had the people at large of the<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_038" id="page_038"></a>{38}</span> actualities of war that many
      Washingtonians and tourists, of all ages and sexes, drove down in
      carriages to watch the battle from a safe position on the hillside.
      Fighting began on the morning of Sunday, July 21, and the first reports
      that reached the city described everything as going favorably to the Union
      cause. The despatches sent to Northern newspapers all reflected this view,
      and some went pretty elaborately into detail concerning incidents on
      various parts of the field. But suddenly the tide turned, and with a
      panicky force which started the whole body of Federal troops on a
      pell-mell rush for Washington. The light-hearted spectators ran, too,
      often impeding the retreat of the soldiers by getting their carriages
      wedged together on a bridge or a narrow road, while the air shook with
      mingled profanity and prayers, punctuated with hysterics. Not a few of the
      carriage folk, as night drew near, became so terrified that they cut their
      harness and rode their horses bareback, two sometimes clinging to one
      animal. The Confederates, discovering the rout, were as much surprised as
      the Federals. They set out to follow their foes, but, not fully grasping
      the real conditions, stopped about fifteen miles short of Washington and
      waited for morning, thus giving the fugitive army a chance to recover from
      its first demoralization. Had they<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_039"
      id="page_039"></a>{39}</span> pressed on, they might have taken possession
      of the capital that night, captured the stored munitions, and looted the
      Treasury; and the record of the next four years must have been written in
      a different vein.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the true story had been brought in by the fleeing
      non-combatants, and the Associated Press attempted to send out a
      correction of first reports, but discovered too late that the Government
      had seized all the telegraph lines and established a temporary censorship,
      postponing any further dissemination of news. As far as known, only one
      prominent paper in the North was able to describe the disaster in its
      Monday morning’s issue. That was a Philadelphia journal, whose
      correspondent had taken to his heels as soon as the panic began. By the
      time he reached Washington, he was so convinced that the Confederates were
      going to capture the city at once, that he boarded a train which was just
      pulling out for Philadelphia, and at his desk in his home office dictated
      his observations of the battle and the stampede.
    </p>
    <p>
      The President, having received only cheering bulletins in the earlier part
      of Sunday, went out for his usual drive in the cool of the afternoon. On
      his return, about half-past six o’clock, he found awaiting him a request
      to come immediately to General Scott’s room at the War Department. All his
      Cabinet had gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_040" id="page_040"></a>{40}</span>
      there, and his hurried consultation with them resulted in messages
      directing various movements of troops in the field, and appeals to the
      Governors of the loyal States for more men. When he came back to his
      office, he threw himself upon a lounge, where he spent the night, not in
      sleep, but in listening to, and closely catechising, parties of civilians
      who had made their way in from Manassas and had hastened to the White
      House to pour their disjointed narratives into his ear. By daylight the
      streets of Washington presented a pitiful spectacle. Ordinary business was
      almost at a standstill; excited citizens were gathered in knots at every
      corner; and a multitude of disheartened soldiers, lacking leaders and
      organization, not knowing where to look for their next orders and thinking
      with dread of the effect the bad news would have upon their friends at
      home, were wandering aimlessly about. The President, after twenty-four
      hours of anxiety, was greatly relieved when the responses from the
      Northern States began to reach him, showing that the shock had not broken
      the faith of the people but had awakened them to the realities of the
      situation. This change was reflected in the Cabinet councils, too, where a
      sudden revision of opinion was observed on the part of those members who
      had fancied that the war would be merely a three months’ holiday&mdash;a<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_041" id="page_041"></a>{41}</span> triumphal
      march of a Northern army from Mason and Dixon’s line to the Gulf of
      Mexico.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not a history of the civil conflict; its beginnings have been thus
      outlined only because they made so deep an impress on the future of
      Washington, which, from being generally regarded by the American people
      with comparative indifference, had become a center of interest for all the
      world. The city was not again seriously threatened with capture till July,
      1864, when the Confederate General, Jubal A. Early, with a corps of
      seasoned soldiers, had worked his way around so as to descend upon it from
      the north. The news of his approach, spreading through the community, did
      not cause the consternation which might have been expected in view of the
      slight defensive preparation that had been made in the menaced quarter.
      Requisitions were sent to the army in Northern Virginia for such troops as
      could be spared. Wounded and discharged Union veterans shouldered their
      guns once more. The male nurses in the hospitals were drafted for active
      duty. A troop of cavalry was recruited among the civilian teamsters at
      work in the city. From all the executive Departments the able-bodied
      clerks were called out, armed with rifles or muskets as far as possible,
      and for the rest with pistols, old cutlasses, axes, shovels, and whatever<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_042" id="page_042"></a>{42}</span> other
      implements might be turned to emergency use, and ranged up on the
      sidewalks for elementary instruction and drill. Those who were least
      strong or most poorly armed were organized into a home-guard, to act as a
      last reserve if the Confederates succeeded in piercing a line of
      earthworks thrown out north of the city. Some of these fortifications can
      still be identified, though worn away by a half-century’s exposure to a
      variable climate, overgrown with trees and vines, and at intervals used as
      building sites. The most interesting of the chain is Fort Stevens, near
      the present Seventh Street Road, for there President Lincoln stood for
      hours under fire, refusing to go home as long as there seemed a chance
      that his presence could lend any inspiration to the men. The invading
      force was repulsed after a two days’ effort to break through, and
      Washington breathed freely once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      We come now to the concluding stage of the great struggle. Mr. Lincoln was
      reëlected in November, 1864, and inaugurated on the fourth of March, 1865,
      making the chief theme of his address a plea for generous treatment of the
      South. Within a month Richmond fell, and five days after that General Lee
      surrendered his army. There was great rejoicing in Washington over both
      these portents of peace, and parties of men and women paraded the streets
      after<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_043" id="page_043"></a>{43}</span>

      nightfall, singing patriotic songs in front of the dwellings of prominent
      Government officers. On the night of April 11 a great crowd gathered in
      the White House yard, loudly cheering the President and calling for a
      speech. Having been notified in advance, he had jotted down a few remarks
      which he now read from manuscript. This memory of him we shall take away
      with us, as he stood framed in an open window, with one of his secretaries
      at his side holding a lighted candle for him to see by, and his little son
      Tad taking from his hand the pages of manuscript, one by one, as he
      finished reading them, while the rest of his family, with radiant faces,
      were grouped where they could overlook the scene.

      Three nights later, almost at the same hour, Booth’s bullet laid the good
      man low in his box at Ford’s Theater; and in a little back hall bedroom of
      the house across the street to which he was carried, he breathed his last
      at an early hour on the following morning. Simultaneously with the
      shooting of Mr. Lincoln, an attempt was made to kill Secretary Seward, and
      the detectives unearthed evidence of a wide conspiracy, which contemplated
      a simultaneous murder of the President, the Vice-president, all the
      Cabinet, and General Grant. The conspirators were soon tracked. Booth was
      shot in a Virginia barn in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_044"
      id="page_044"></a>{44}</span> he had taken refuge from his pursuers; four
      others were tried by a military commission and hanged.

      Andrew Johnson, the Vice-president, was not a tactful man, and had already
      drawn upon himself the enmity of the radical wing of his party in
      Congress, which was intensified by his first acts as President,
      foreshadowing a considerate policy toward the South. A tiresome petty
      warfare set in, Johnson vetoing bill after bill, only to see it repassed
      over his veto. Of the members of the Lincoln Cabinet he had retained,
      Secretary Stanton was the one with whom he had most friction, and in
      August, 1867, he called for Stanton’s resignation, designating General
      Grant to manage the War Department temporarily. On Stanton’s refusal to
      resign, Johnson suspended him, and Grant took over the Department and held
      it till the Senate adopted a resolution declaring its non-concurrence in
      Stanton’s suspension. Then Grant stepped out, and Stanton returned to
      duty. Johnson suspended him again, this time designating General Lorenzo
      Thomas to act in his stead. Matters had now reached a climax, and the
      House in 1868 impeached the President. His trial by the Senate consumed
      nearly two months and ended in a failure to convict. In view of this
      defeat, Stanton resigned, and from that time till the close of his term
      President Johnson continued his quarrel<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_045" id="page_045"></a>{45}</span> with the opponents of his
      policy, celebrating his last Christmas in the White House by proclaiming a
      general pardon and amnesty, so framed as to include all grades of
      political offenders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson was President when the enlargement of the Capitol building was
      finished, including the rearing of the present dome. While the alterations
      were in progress, the grand two days’ parade of the victorious armies took
      place on Pennsylvania Avenue, the President reviewing it as it passed the
      White House. General Grant was elected by the Republicans to succeed
      Johnson, taking office in March, 1869. During the next sixteen years,
      divided between his two terms and the administrations of Hayes, Garfield,
      and Arthur, Washington almost doubled in population. While Grant was
      President, it was so constantly in the public eye that many rich men
      discerned its future possibilities and invested in real estate there. Army
      and navy officers, retired from active duty, found it pleasant to settle
      down where they would be most likely to meet their old comrades. A few
      scholars drifted in, so as to have easy access to the Government libraries
      and records. Thus, in both a material and a social way, Washington took a
      strong upward start.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the esthetic side of the general change, less can<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_046" id="page_046"></a>{46}</span> be said in praise. Most of
      the dwellings built during this era can still be distinguished by their
      gratuitous ugliness. The parks became strewn with flower-beds of fantastic
      shape, overrun by a riot of inharmonious colors. Statues sprang up like
      mushrooms, unrelated in size or style or any other quality. Alterations of
      street grades left little houses perched on bluffs and leaning against big
      neighbors built at the new level, or sunk in dingy pits. All this
      contributed to give the city an unfinished look, like that of a child
      growing out of its small clothes. Over the whole process of transformation
      loomed its master figure, Alexander R. Shepherd.
    </p>
    <p>
      No man of his day, unless it were Grant himself, endured more wholesale
      denunciation or found more valiant defenders than he. Like Grant, who
      believed in him thoroughly, he had an iron will which treated all
      obstacles as negligible when he had set himself to accomplish a certain
      end. As a plumber by trade and a very competent one, he had accumulated a
      fortune before middle life. Early in his business career he had made up
      his mind that Washington’s failure to fulfil L’Enfant’s ideal of a
      beautiful capital was due to the sluggishness which pervaded it, and this
      he resolved to dispel. Grant listened to his projects and encouraged them.
      The first step was to abolish<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_047"
      id="page_047"></a>{47}</span> the existing form of municipal government
      and to substitute a Territorial form, with a Governor and a Board of
      Public Works. Shepherd was made vice-president of the Board and virtually
      its dictator.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he had to face in his effort to launch the city afresh can hardly be
      conceived by an observer of to-day. Although ten years had elapsed since
      the outbreak of the great war of which Washington was the focal center,
      local conditions had improved but slightly upon those described toward the
      close of the previous chapter. The road-bed of Pennsylvania Avenue had
      received a pavement of wood, which was fast going to pieces. A single
      square in Vermont Avenue was surfaced with a coal-tar product that had
      proved its unfitness. A few other streets had been spread with a thick
      coat of gravel, which, as it was gradually ground down, filled the air
      with fine grit whenever the wind blew. The rest of the highways were
      either paved with cobblestones or left in their primitive dirt, which
      became nearly impassable in very wet weather for mud, and in very dry
      weather for dust. It was not uncommon for a heavy vehicle like a
      fire-engine to get stalled when it most needed to hurry, and to avoid this
      contingency the engines sometimes ran over the sidewalk. In the
      northwestern quarter, now so attractive, the marshes were undrained, and
      the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_048" id="page_048"></a>{48}</span>
      forced to live there suffered tortures from chills and fever. There was no
      efficient system of scavenging, but swine were kept in back yards of
      dwellings to devour the kitchen refuse. Poultry and cattle roamed freely
      about the vacant lots in thinly settled neighborhoods. There were several
      open sewers; and the street sweepings, including offal of a highly
      offensive sort, were dumped on the common south of Pennsylvania Avenue and
      strewn over the plots set apart for lawns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because Shepherd foresaw the hostility he would excite by his program of
      reforms, and that what he did must therefore be done quickly, he crowded
      into three years what might well have consumed twenty. To save time and
      cut red tape, he awarded contracts to friends whom he believed to be as
      much in earnest as he was&mdash;a practice which of course laid him open
      to accusations of favoritism; he experimented with novel materials and
      methods, many of which proved ill-adapted to his needs; and his
      expenditures reached figures which surprised even him when he found
      leisure to foot up his debit page. But he shirked nothing because of the
      danger or trouble it might involve for himself, and his opponents had to
      lie awake nights to outwit him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, there stood on the present site of the<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_049" id="page_049"></a>{49}</span> Public Library in Mount
      Vernon Square a ramshackle old market building, the owners of which had
      contrived so to intrench themselves behind legal technicalities that they
      could not be ousted by any ordinary process. One evening, after the courts
      were closed, a platoon of brawny laborers was marched up to the building,
      armed with battering-rams, axes, and sledge-hammers, and, before
      proprietors or tenants could hunt up a judge to interfere, the party had
      reduced the market to kindling wood and prepared the ground for conversion
      into a public park. Again, when the time came to improve the lower end of
      Pennsylvania Avenue, a railroad crossing stood in the way. It had been
      laid during the war, with no legal warrant but as a temporary military
      necessity, and the company had repeatedly refused to remove it. So at one
      o’clock one Sunday morning, when injunctions were out of the question,
      Shepherd brought down a gang of trusty men and proceeded to tear up the
      rails, which could never thereafter be replaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boldness of this performance so stirred the admiration of John W.
      Garrett, one of the most powerful railway magnates of the day, that he
      offered Shepherd a vice-presidency of the Baltimore and Ohio Company. But
      Shepherd was not to be lured away. He was promoted by Grant from the
      vice-presidency of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_050" id="page_050"></a>{50}</span>
      the Board of Public Works to the Governorship of the District, a move
      which, though flattering, made him all the more shining a mark for attack;
      and a group of large landowners, shuddering at the prospect of further
      increases in taxation, induced Congress to reorganize the local
      government, wiping out entirely the Territorial system and popular
      suffrage, and putting the administration of affairs into the hands of
      three Commissioners to be appointed for limited terms by the President.
      This plan has remained substantially unchanged for more than forty years,
      to the satisfaction of the citizens who have most at stake in the welfare
      of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having entered office rich at the age of thirty, Shepherd quitted it at
      thirty-three so poor that he had to begin life anew in the Mexican mining
      country. He left as his monument a record expenditure of twenty-six
      million dollars, about half that amount remaining as a bonded debt; many
      miles of newly opened or extended streets; a splendid achievement in
      shade-tree installation and parking improvement; modern water, sanitation,
      and lighting plants; and, above all, an awakened popular spirit as to
      civic advancement. Albeit his ways of working out his plans often were so
      crude as to shock the sense of quieter people and not to be commended as a
      continuing force for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_051" id="page_051"></a>{51}</span>

      good, they served their time, which needed the application of a crowbar
      rather than a cambric needle.
    </p>
    <p>
      True to his human type, Shepherd was an odd mixture of incongruities. He
      poured out public funds like water, yet profited never a cent himself. In
      his own fashion he was pious, yet he could swear like a trooper when
      aroused, and once halted in the midst of family prayers to order a servant
      to “drive that damned cow out of the rose-bushes!” He was overheard, after
      hurling imprecations at some contractor who had mishandled a job,
      murmuring a prayer to the Almighty to forgive and forget his momentary
      loss of temper. A lady who once engaged him as a plumber to hang a
      chandelier in her parlor noticed that it swayed under her touch, and sent
      for him again to make sure that it would not fall upon the heads of her
      guests. His answer was to mount a chair on one side of the room, pull the
      chandelier toward him till he could grasp it with both hands, jump off,
      and swing his whole weight of two hundred and twenty-five pounds across to
      a chair on the opposite side. This exhibition of his confidence in his
      work completely restored hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little more need be told here. The sodden soil plowed up by Shepherd was
      gradually harrowed and seeded, watched and watered, till it brought forth
      a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_052" id="page_052"></a>{52}</span>
      new city, which under later administrations, in spite of many
      vicissitudes, has prospered in the main. Presidents Cleveland, Harrison,
      and McKinley took an interest in it which, while kindly, had some of the
      detached quality of their interest in any of the States or Territories;
      under them, however, the beautiful Rock Creek National Park and its
      neighbor the “Zoo” were planned and largely developed, and the
      pleasure-ground and suburban expansion programs received a considerable
      impetus. President Roosevelt felt a lively sense of the importance of the
      city as the capital of a great nation. It was in his time that the White
      House underwent its restoration, and the L’Enfant plan generally was
      revived as a standard. He was responsible, also, for attracting to
      Washington, as permanent residents, many literary and scientific workers
      whom it had formerly welcomed only as visitors, and the foundation of the
      Carnegie Institution went far to make this period notable in local annals.
      Mr. Taft’s interest took more the neighborly bent, as if Washington were
      his home. He bore an active part in the popular movements for beautifying
      the city, not so much because it was a capital, as because he wished to
      have a hand in the civic enterprises of his fellow townsmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      President Wilson’s attitude has not thus far been<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_053" id="page_053"></a>{53}</span> so clearly defined as that
      of his recent predecessors. Other pressing public concerns have left him
      scant time for looking into municipal improvement projects. Mrs. Wilson,
      however, gave them much attention; and a hope expressed during her last
      illness so touched the heart of Congress as to bring about the enactment
      of some long-delayed legislation to abate the use of unwholesome alleys
      for the tenements of the poor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_054"

    <h2>
      <a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III<br /><br /> <small>“ON
      THE HILL”</small>
    </h2>
    <p class="nind">
      <span class="letra">I</span>N the ordinary conversation of Washington, one
      rarely hears Congress mentioned by name. The respective functions of its
      two chambers are so generally understood that it is common to distinguish
      between them: the Senate yesterday did so-and-so; something is about to
      occur in the House of Representatives. In speaking of the lawmakers
      collectively, the familiar phrase is “the gentlemen on the hill.”
      Washington has several hills, but “the” hill is by universal consent the
      one on which the Capitol stands.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the visitor who knows the city only in its present aspect, the choice
      of this hill for the monumental building now crowning it seems most
      natural. This is not, however, the place originally considered for the
      purpose. James Madison favored Shuter’s Hill, an eminence a little west of
      Alexandria, now embraced in the tract set apart for George Washington
      Park. Thomas Jefferson supported Madison in this preference; but President
      Washington, feeling that Virginia<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_055"
      id="page_055"></a>{55}</span> had already had her full share of the honors
      in launching the new republic, insisted that the most important
      architecture at the seat of government should stand on the Maryland side
      of the Potomac. His view prevailed; and, when the sites of the principal
      public buildings were marked on L’Enfant’s plan of the city, that selected
      for the Capitol was the elevation which, besides being fairly central,
      commanded in its outlook, and was commanded by, the greatest area of
      country on both sides of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like almost everything else architectural in Washington, the Capitol is a
      pile of gradual growth, subjected to many changes of detail in the plans.
      Sketches were submitted in competition for a prize; the two competitors
      who came nearest to meeting the requirements, though adopted citizens of
      the United States, were respectively of French and English birth; and the
      drawings finally evolved from the general scheme of the one modified by
      the more acceptable ideas of the other were turned over to an Irishman to
      perfect and carry out. Most of the credit belongs, undoubtedly, to Doctor
      William Thornton, a draftsman by profession, who afterward became
      Superintendent of Patents. The material used was freestone from a
      neighboring quarry. Only the north or Senate end was far enough advanced
      by the autumn of 1800 to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_056"
      id="page_056"></a>{56}</span> enable Congress to hold its short session
      there, and the disputes which arose over the succeeding stages of the work
      led President Jefferson to call in Benjamin H. Latrobe of Richmond, the
      first architect of already established rank who had had anything to do
      with it. Under his direction, the south end was made habitable by 1811;
      and the House of Representatives, which till then had been uncomfortably
      quartered in such odd places as it could find, took possession. There was
      no central structure connecting the Senate and House ends, but a roofed
      wooden passageway led from the one to the other. In this condition was the
      Capitol when, in 1814, the British invaders burned all of it that was
      burnable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heavier masonry, of course, was unaffected by the fire except for the
      need of a little patchwork here and there; but in his task of restoration
      Mr. Latrobe found himself so embarrassed by dissensions between the
      dignitaries who gave him his orders that after three vexatious years he
      resigned, and the celebrated Charles Bulfinch of Boston took his place. In
      1830 Mr. Bulfinch pronounced the building finished and returned home, and
      for twenty years it remained substantially as he left it. Then, the needs
      of Congress having outgrown the space at their disposal, Thomas U. Walter
      of Philadelphia was ordered to prepare plans<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_057" id="page_057"></a>{57}</span> for an enlargement, and he
      was far-sighted enough to make the extension the vehicle for some other
      improvements. The great wings attached to the northern and southern
      extremities were built of white marble, which has rendered imperative the
      frequent repainting of the old freestone surfaces to match; the dome was
      raised proportionally; and additions made, then and since, to the
      surrounding grounds, have given the building an appropriate setting and
      vastly enhanced its beauty of approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is, in brief, the story of the Capitol as we find it to-day. A stroll
      through it will call up other memories. As you look at the building from
      the east, you will be struck by the difference in tint between the painted
      main structure and the two marble wings. Imagine the wings cut off and the
      dome reduced to about half its present height and ended abruptly in a flat
      top, and you have in your mind’s eye a picture of the Capitol as Bulfinch
      left it, and as it remained till shortly before the Civil War. Its most
      conspicuous feature now is its towering dome, surmounted by a bronze
      allegorical figure of American Freedom. As the sculptor Crawford
      originally modeled the image, its head was crowned with the conventional
      liberty-cap; but Jefferson Davis, then Secretary of War, objected to this
      on the ground that it was the sign of a freed<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_058" id="page_058"></a>{58}</span> slave, whereas Americans
      were born free. The cap was therefore discarded in favor of the present
      helmet of eagle feathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Filling the pediment over the main portico is a bit of sculpture which
      enjoys the distinction of having been designed by John Quincy Adams,
      because he could not find an artist who could draw him what he wished. It
      consists of three figures: the Genius of America in the center and Hope
      and Justice on either side, Justice appearing without her customary
      blindfold. Flanking the main staircase are two groups of statuary. That on
      our left is called “The Discovery”&mdash;Columbus holding aloft a globe,
      while an Indian woman crouches at his feet. It was done by the Italian
      sculptor Persico, who copied Columbus’s armor from the last suit actually
      worn by him. And now comes a bit of politics; for Congress, having awarded
      this work to a foreigner, was besieged by a demand that the next order be
      given to an American, and accordingly engaged Horatio Greenough to produce
      “The Rescue,” which stands on our right. It represents a frontiersman
      saving his wife and child from capture by an Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The portico has an historic association with another President besides
      Adams, for it was here that an attempt was made upon the life of Andrew
      Jackson.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_059" id="page_059"></a>{59}</span>
      At the close of a funeral service in the House of Representatives, he had
      just passed out of the rotunda to descend the steps, when a demented
      mechanic named Lawrence sprang from a place of hiding, aimed a pistol at
      him, and pulled the trigger. As they were less than ten feet apart, the
      President was saved only by the failure of the powder to explode. Lawrence
      instantly dropped the useless pistol and tried another, with like effect.
      Jackson never could be talked out of the idea that Lawrence was the tool
      of political conspirators who wished to put some one else in his place as
      President.
    </p>
    <p>
      We enter the building between the bronze doors designed by Randolph
      Rogers, commonly called the “Columbus doors” because they tell, in a
      series of reliefs, the life story of the discoverer. In the rotunda, the
      center of the building, we find ourselves surrounded by paintings and
      sculpture dealing with historical subjects. Hung at even intervals are
      eight large canvases, of which four are by John Trumbull, a portrait
      painter who was also an officer of the patriot army in the Revolution. For
      the one representing the signing of the Declaration of Independence, old
      John Randolph could find no better designation than “the shin piece,”
      because “such a collection of legs never before came together in any one
      picture”; but a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_060" id="page_060"></a>{60}</span>
      friendly commentator has discovered by actual count that, of the nearly
      fifty figures, only ten show either legs or feet, the rest being relieved
      by drapery or deep shadows. In another, the “Resignation of General
      Washington,” are the figures of two girls, which have given rise to many a
      discussion among sightseers because the pair seem to have five hands
      between them; I shall not attempt to solve the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paintings of the “Landing of Columbus,” “Discovery of the
      Mississippi,” “Baptism of Pocahontas,” and “Embarkation of the Pilgrims”
      are from the brushes of Vanderlyn, Powell, Chapman, and Weir respectively.
      Their subjects permit of picturesque costumes and dramatic groupings which
      Trumbull could not use. But whatever his limitations, we owe to him,
      probably more than to any other one man, the rotunda as we know it.
      Bulfinch had under consideration various schemes of treatment for the
      center of the building, but Trumbull’s foremost thought was of a good
      light for his pictures; and, as he was a valued friend of the architect,
      the pertinacity with which he urged this design won the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four doors pierce the circular chamber, and over each is a rectangle of
      sculpture in high relief. As works of art, the quartet are little short of
      execrable, but as milestones on the path of esthetic development<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_061" id="page_061"></a>{61}</span> in
      America they have a charm of their own. All were the work of Italian
      sculptors, whose acquaintance with our domestic history and concerns was
      presumptively scant; and when the tablet showing William Penn negotiating
      his treaty with the Indians was first exhibited to the public, the head of
      the gentle Quaker was adorned with a cocked hat and military queue. It was
      necessary, therefore, to decapitate him and set upon his shoulders the
      head he now wears. All four reliefs deal with our aboriginal problem. In
      one, the Indians are welcoming the Pilgrim Fathers with a gift of corn; in
      another, they are conveying to Penn the land on which Philadelphia now
      stands; in a third, Pocahontas is saving the life of Captain John Smith;
      while in the fourth, Caucasian civilization, personified in Daniel Boone,
      has already killed one Indian and is engaged in bloody combat with a
      second. The series drew from an old chief the comment that they told the
      true story of the way the white race had repaid the hospitality of the red
      race by exterminating it; and another observer, pointing to the huddled-up
      body of the fallen Indian under Boone’s foot, remarked: “The white man has
      not left the Indian land enough even to die on!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Running all around the circular wall and immediately under the dome
      opening, we note an unfinished frieze,<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_062" id="page_062"></a>{62}</span> so done in neutral tints as
      to convey the suggestion of relief sculpture, depicting the most notable
      events in the history of America from the landing of Columbus to the
      discovery of gold in California. Six of the fourteen scenes were painted
      by Constantino Brumidi, and the others after sketches left by him. It was
      an ambitious design, in view of the rapidity with which history is made
      now and the brevity of the space. Only a trifling gap is left for all that
      has happened in the last sixty years or so, and Congress has had more than
      one debate over what ought to be crowded into the record of this interval.
      Among the subjects considered have been the emancipation of the slaves,
      the completion of the first transcontinental railroad, and the freeing of
      Cuba; but the proposal which has met with most favor is a symbolic
      treatment of the Civil War, not as a breach between the sections but as
      the cementing of a stronger bond. This was set aside because the design
      outlined was a representation of Grant and Lee clasping hands under the
      Appomattox apple tree&mdash;the objection being based on the discovery
      that the apple tree existed only in fiction, and that the real
      meeting-place of the two commanders was too unromantic for artistic use.

      inverted bowl enclosing an elaborate fresco in colors. This, too, is from
      the brush of Brumidi. Although it is ostensibly allegorical, many of its
      sixty-three human faces are recognizable portraits, including those of
      Washington, Franklin, Hamilton, Robert Morris, Samuel F. B. Morse, Robert
      Fulton, and Thomas U. Walter, who was architect of the Capitol while the
      work was in progress. In a group representing War, with an armed goddess
      of liberty for its center, are heads resembling those of Jefferson Davis,
      Alexander H. Stephens, Robert E. Lee, and John B. Floyd. Whether the
      likenesses are there by the deliberate intent of the artist, or merely by
      accident, no one will ever know, as Brumidi died in 1880.

    <p>
      The door on our left leads, through a short corridor, into what was once
      the Hall of Representatives. It is now known officially as the Hall of
      Statuary, but to irreverent critics as the National Chamber of Horrors,
      because of the varied assortment of marble and bronze images collected
      there. The room is semicircular, with a domed ceiling, a great arch and
      supporting pillars on its flat side, and a colonnade lining the horseshoe.
      During the forty years that it was used for legislative purposes, a
      rostrum holding the Speaker’s table and chair filled the arch, and the
      desks of the Representatives were arranged in concentric curves to face<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_064" id="page_064"></a>{64}</span> it.
      Overlooking the chamber, and following most of the rear wall, ran a narrow
      gallery for visitors who did not enjoy the privileges of the floor; it
      derived an air of comfort from curtains hung between the columns of the
      colonnade and looped back so as to produce the effect of a tier of
      opera-boxes. Stay in the room a while, and you will understand why, for
      many years, the complaint of its acoustic properties was so constant, and
      a demand for a better hall so strong: it is a wonderful whispering
      gallery. There are spots in the tiled pavement where you can stand and
      hear the slightest sound you make come back from some point before or
      behind you, over your head, or under your feet. Go to the place where the
      semicircle ends on one side of the room, and I will go to the
      corresponding place on the other side, and, by speaking into the vertical
      fissures between the wall and the pillars at the two extremities of the
      great arch, we can converse in the lowest tones with as much ease as if we
      were side by side instead of a hundred feet apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      A vivid imagination can people this hall with ghosts. Here some of the
      fiercest forensic battles were fought in early days over protective
      tariffs, internal improvements, and, above all, negro slavery. Here it was
      that Randolph’s piping voice denounced the Northern “dough-faces,” and
      here Wilmot launched his historic<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_065"
      id="page_065"></a>{65}</span> proviso. Here Alexander H. Stephens made his
      last effort to resuscitate the moribund Whig party, while Abraham Lincoln
      listened to his argument from a seat on the same side of the chamber. Here
      John Quincy Adams drew upon himself the fire of an incensed opposition by
      championing the people’s right to petition Congress, and here he fell to
      the floor a dying paralytic. Here John Marshall, the greatest of our Chief
      Justices, administered the oath of office to two early Presidents. And
      here it was that Henry Clay, as Speaker, delivered his address of welcome
      to Lafayette as the guest of the nation, and listened with becoming
      gravity to the Marquis’s response&mdash;which, as it afterward appeared,
      owed its excellent English to the fact that Clay had composed it for the
      most part himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversion of the hall from its former to its present uses was at the
      instance of the late Senator Morrill of Vermont, who procured legislation
      permitting every State in the Union to contribute two statues of
      distinguished citizens to this temple of fame. No restriction having been
      placed on the sizes of the figures, one result of his well-meant effort is
      a grotesque array of pigmies and giants, some of the personages biggest in
      life being most diminutive in effigy, while others of comparatively
      insignificant stature are here given massive proportions. Most of the
      notables<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_066" id="page_066"></a>{66}</span>
      thus immortalized are persons with whose names we associate a story. Here
      stand, for example, Ethan Allen as he may have looked when demanding the
      surrender of Fort Ticonderoga “in the name of the great Jehovah and the
      Continental Congress”; Charles Carroll, who wrote Carrollton after his
      name so that the servants of the King, when sent to hang him for signing
      the Declaration, would know where to find him; sturdy John Stark, who
      snapped his fingers at Congress and whipped the British at Bennington in
      his own fashion; Muhlenberg, the patriot parson, throwing back his gown at
      the close of his sermon and standing forth as a Continental soldier; and
      fiery Jim Shields, who once challenged Lincoln to a duel, but was laughed
      out of it when, arriving on the field, he found his adversary already
      there, mowing the tall grass with a cutlass to make the fighting easier!
    </p>
    <p>
      Another corridor brings us to the present Hall of Representatives, which
      has been in use since the latter part of 1857. It is a spacious
      rectangular room, with a high ceiling chiefly of glass, through which it
      is lighted in the daytime by the sun and after nightfall by the modified
      glow of electric lamps in the attic. Its plan is that of an amphitheater,
      the platform occupied by the Speaker being at the lowest level in the
      middle of the long southern side. Facing this<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_067" id="page_067"></a>{67}</span> are the concentric curved
      benches of the members. Formerly the body of the hall was filled with
      desks but, as the membership increased with the population of the country,
      these were found to take up too much room, not to mention the temptation
      they offered for letter-writing and other diversions. Back of the
      Speaker’s chair hang a full-length portrait of Washington by Vanderlyn and
      one of Lafayette by Ary Schaeffer. The Washington is the conventional
      portrait as far as the waist-line, but the legs were borrowed from a
      prominent citizen of Maryland, who had a better pair than the General, and
      who consented to pose them for the benefit of posterity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let us go back to the north or Senate wing of the building. On our way
      we swing around a little open air-well, through which we look down into
      the corresponding corridor of the basement. The well is surrounded by a
      colonnade supporting the base of a circular skylight. The columns are
      worth noticing, because their capitals are of native design, using the
      leaf of the tobacco plant somewhat conventionalized. They date from the
      period when the clerk of the United States Supreme Court, whose office is
      near by, used to receive a part of his compensation in tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few steps more bring us to the Court itself, sitting in a chamber
      considerably smaller than the Hall of<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_068" id="page_068"></a>{68}</span> Statuary, but laid out on
      the same plan. This was the first legislative chamber ever occupied in the
      Capitol, having been till 1859 the Hall of the Senate. Here it was that
      Thomas Jefferson was twice inaugurated as President. Here Daniel Webster
      pronounced the famous “reply to Hayne” which every boy orator once learned
      to spout from the rostrum. Here Preston Brooks made his murderous assault
      upon Charles Sumner, and here Henry Clay delivered the farewell address
      which we used to find in all the school readers. On the walls of this
      chamber once hung the life-size oil portraits of Louis XVI. and Marie
      Antoinette, which were presented by the Government of France to the
      Government of the United States just after our Revolution, and which
      disappeared when the British burned the Capitol in 1814. The room has
      always suffered from the same bad acoustic properties which caused the
      House of Representatives to exchange its old hall for its new one; and it
      has a similar whispering gallery, so that a court officer in one corner
      can communicate with a colleague in the other in a tone so low as to be
      inaudible to any one else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since it took possession here, the Court has rendered its legal tender and
      anti-trust decisions, and a number of others of historic importance. In
      this room sat, in 1877, the Electoral Commission which decided that<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_069" id="page_069"></a>{69}</span> Mr. Hayes
      was entitled to take office as President. Here occurs, every day during a
      term, the one ancient and impressive ceremonial which can be witnessed at
      our seat of government. At the stroke of noon there appears at the right
      corner of the chamber the crier, who in a loud voice announces: “The
      Honorable the Supreme Court of the United States!” All present&mdash;attorneys,
      spectators, and minor functionaries&mdash;rise and remain standing while
      the members of the Court enter in single file, the Chief Justice leading.
      The lawyers bow to the Justices, who return the bow before sinking into
      their chairs. Thereupon the crier makes his second announcement: “Oyez!
      Oyez! Oyez! All persons having business with the Honorable the Supreme
      Court of the United States are admonished to draw near and give attention,
      as the Court is now sitting. God save the United States and this Honorable
      Court!”
    </p>
    <p>
      All the Justices wear gowns of black silk. John Jay, the first Chief
      Justice, relieved the somber monotony of his by adding a collar bound with
      scarlet, but the precedent was not followed. The Court has sometimes been
      styled the most dignified judicial tribunal in the world, and doubtless it
      deserves the compliment. Certainly no American need blush for its decorum.
      The whole atmosphere of its chamber is in keeping<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_070" id="page_070"></a>{70}</span> with the fact, reverently
      voiced by one of its old colored servitors, that “dey ain’t no appeal f’m
      dis yere Co’t ’xcep’ to God Almighty.” The arguments made before it are
      confined to calm, unemotional reasoning. The pleaders do not raise their
      voices, or forget their manners, or indulge in personalities or oratory
      while debating: and the opinions of the Court are recited with a quietness
      almost conversational. These opinions are very carefully guarded up to the
      moment they are read from the bench; but now and then, after a decision
      has become history, there leaks out an entertaining story of how it came
      to be rendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      One such instance was in the case of an imported delicacy which might have
      been classed either as a preparation of fish or as a flavoring sauce. The
      customs officers had levied duty on it as a sauce, and an importer had
      appealed. The Justices, when they came to compare notes, confessed
      themselves sorely puzzled, and one of them suggested that, since the
      technical arguments were so well balanced, it might be wise to fall back
      upon common sense. That evening he carried a sample of the disputed
      substance home to his wife, who was an expert in culinary matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There, my dear,” said he, “is a sauce for you to try.”
    </p>
    <p>
      With one look at the contents of the package,<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_071" id="page_071"></a>{71}</span> which she evidently
      recognized, she exclaimed: “Pshaw! That’s no sauce; that’s fish&mdash;didn’t
      you know it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the Court met again for consultation, and on the following
      Monday handed down a decision overruling the customs officers and
      sustaining the importer’s appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the court-room and continuing northward, we come to the present
      Hall of the Senate. It is smaller than the present Hall of Representatives
      and also cleaner looking and more comfortable. When Congress is in full
      session, the contrast may be extended further so as to include what we
      hear as well as what we see, for there is little likeness between the two
      houses in the matter of orderliness of procedure. But that’s another
      story, which will keep. It was from this chamber that the Senators from
      the seceding States took their departure in 1860 and 1861. For years
      afterward the first request of every visiting stranger was to be shown the
      seats formerly occupied by these men. As long as the old doorkeeper of the
      Senate, Captain Bassett, lived, he was reputed to be the only person who
      knew the history of every desk on the floor. Whether he transmitted this
      knowledge to any of his assistants before his death, I cannot say; but
      more than once he saved some of the furniture<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_072" id="page_072"></a>{72}</span> from injury at the hands of
      wanton vandals or curio collectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the early days of the Civil War, a party of Northern zouaves,
      passing through the city on their way to the front, entered the Senate
      Hall during a recess and tried to identify Davis’s desk. They frankly
      avowed their purpose of destroying, if possible, the last trace of the
      Confederate President’s connection with the United States Government; but
      Bassett refused to be coaxed, bribed, or bullied into revealing the
      information they wished. Their persistency presently aroused his fears
      lest they might come back later and renew their attempt in his absence; so
      he resorted to diplomacy and made them a little speech, reminding them
      that, no matter what Mr. Davis might have done to provoke their
      indignation, the desk at which he had sat was not his property, but that
      of the Government which they had come South to defend. His reasoning had
      its effect, and, admitting that he was right, they went away peaceably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back of the Senate chamber are two rooms set apart for the President and
      Vice-president respectively. Till lately, the President’s room as a rule
      has been occupied only during a few closing hours of a session, when the
      President wishes to be readily accessible for the signing of such acts as
      he approves. Sometimes he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_073"
      id="page_073"></a>{73}</span> has spent the entire last night of a
      Congress here, returning to the White House for breakfast and coming to
      the Capitol again for an hour or two before noon. President Wilson has
      used the room more than any of his recent predecessors, going there to
      consult the leading members of his party in Congress while legislation is
      in course of preparation or passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Vice-president’s room has been more constantly in use as a retiring
      room for its occupant during the intervals when he is not presiding over
      the sessions of the Senate. On its wall has hung for many years a little
      gilt-framed mirror for which John Adams, while Vice-president, paid forty
      dollars, and which was brought with the other appurtenances of the Senate
      from Philadelphia when the Government removed its headquarters to
      Washington. Many of the frugal founders of the republic were scandalized
      at the extravagance of the purchase, and one gravely introduced in the
      Senate a resolution censuring Adams for having drawn thus heavily upon the
      public funds “to gratify his personal vanity.” What these good men would
      say if they were to revisit the Capitol now and see in the same room with
      the forty-dollar mirror a silver inkstand that cost two hundred dollars
      and a clock that cost a thousand, we can only imagine. It was in this
      room, by the way, that Vice-president<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_074" id="page_074"></a>{74}</span> Wilson died in November,
      1875, after an attack of illness which suddenly overcame him at the
      Capitol and was too severe to justify his being carried to his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the floor below are two other points of interest. We shall do well to
      descend, not by the broad marble staircases in the north wing, but by an
      old iron-railed and curved flight of stone steps a little south of the
      Supreme Court. Note, in passing, its columns, as truly American in design
      as those above-stairs to which attention has already been directed; for
      they conventionalize our Indian corn, the stalks making the body of a
      pillar and the leaves and ears the capital. The first point we shall visit
      is the crypt, which is directly under the rotunda. It is a vaulted chamber
      originally intended as a resting-place for the body of George Washington.
      There was to have been a circular opening in the ceiling, so that visitors
      in the rotunda could look down upon the sarcophagus, above which a
      suspended taper was to be kept continually burning. The light was duly
      hung there, and not extinguished for many years; but as Washington’s heirs
      were unwilling to allow his remains to leave Mount Vernon, the rest of the
      plan was abandoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little way north of the crypt we come to the room that the Supreme Court
      occupied for about forty<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_075"

      years after the restoration of the Capitol. Out of it was sent the first
      message with which Samuel F. B. Morse announced to the world the success
      of his invention, the magnetic telegraph. Morse was perfectly convinced
      that his device was workable, but he had exhausted his means before being
      able to make a satisfactory experiment. He therefore asked Congress for an
      appropriation to equip a trial line between Washington and Baltimore. Some
      of the members scoffed at his appeal as visionary; others intimated that
      he was trying to impose upon the Government; only a handful seemed to feel
      enough confidence in him and his project to vote for the appropriation.
      After a discouraging struggle lasting till the third of March, 1843, Morse
      was at the Capitol watching the dying hours of the Congress, when his
      friends advised him that his cause was hopeless, and he returned to his
      hotel and went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before breakfast the next morning he received a call from Miss Annie
      Ellsworth, daughter of the Commissioner of Patents, who brought him the
      news that after he had left the Capitol his appropriation had gone
      through, and the President had signed the bill just before midnight. To
      reward her as the bearer of glad tidings, Morse invited her to frame the
      first message to be sent to Baltimore. It took more than a year to<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_076" id="page_076"></a>{76}</span> build the
      line and insure its successful operation; but on May 24, 1844, in the
      presence of a gathering which filled the court chamber, the inventor
      seated himself at the instrument, and Miss Ellsworth placed in his hand a
      phrase she had selected from the twenty-third verse of the twenty-third
      chapter of the Book of Numbers: “What hath God wrought!” In less time than
      it takes to tell the facts, the operator in Baltimore had received the
      message and ticked it back without an error. In that hour of his triumph
      over skepticism and abuse, Morse could have asked almost anything of
      Congress without fear of repulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not all the associations which cling about the Capitol are confined to
      politics or legislation, science or business. The old Hall of
      Representatives was, in the early days of the last century, long used for
      religious meetings on Sundays, the Speaker’s desk being converted
      temporarily into a pulpit. One of the first preachers who held stated
      services there was a Swedenborgian. When the custom had become well
      established, most of the clergymen of the city consented to take the
      Sundays in a certain order of succession. Sir Augustus Foster, a secretary
      of the British Legation during Jefferson’s administration, has left us his
      impressions of the meetings:
    </p>
    <p>
      “A church service can certainly never be called an<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_077" id="page_077"></a>{77}</span> amusement; but, from the
      variety of persons who were allowed to preach in the House of
      Representatives, there doubtless was some alloy of curiosity in the
      motives which led one to go there. Though the regular Chaplain was a
      Presbyterian, sometimes a Methodist, a minister of the Church of England,
      or a Quaker, sometimes even a woman, took the Speaker’s chair, and I do
      not think there was much devotion among the majority. The New Englanders,
      generally speaking, are very religious; but though there are many
      exceptions, I cannot say so much for the Marylanders, and still less for
      the Virginians.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably this comment on the worldly element entering into the meetings
      was called forth by their gradual degeneration into a social function. The
      hall came to be regarded as a pleasant Sunday gathering-place for friends
      who were able to see little of one another during the secular week. They
      clustered in knots around the open fireplaces, apparently quite as
      interested in the intervals afforded for a bit of gossip as in the sermon.
      The President was accustomed to attend from time to time; and possibly it
      was by his order that the Marine Band, nearly one hundred strong and
      attired in their brilliant red uniforms, were present in the gallery and
      played the hymn tunes, as well as some stirring march music. Their
      attendance was discontinued later, as<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_078" id="page_078"></a>{78}</span> their performances attracted
      many common idlers to a hall already crowded almost to suffocation with
      ladies and gentlemen of fashion, and thus increased the confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Partly as a result of this use of the hall, the habit of treating Sunday
      as a day for social festivities of all sorts reached a point where the
      strict Sabbatarians felt called to remonstrate. One, a clergyman named
      Breckenridge, preached a sermon denouncing the irreligious frivolities of
      the time, which created a great sensation. He addressed his remarks
      directly to Congress. “It is not the people,” said he, “who will suffer
      for these enormities. It is the Government. As with Nineveh of old, your
      temples and your palaces will be burned to the ground, for it is by fire
      that this sin has usually been punished!” And he cited instance after
      instance from Bible history, showing how cities, dwellings, and persons
      had been burned for disrespect of divine law.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day in the fall of 1814, after the British had left the city scarred
      with blackened ruins, Mr. Breckenridge was passing the Octagon house, when
      he was hailed by Dolly Madison from the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      “When I listened to that threatening sermon of yours,” she exclaimed, “I
      little thought that its warnings would be realized so soon.”<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_079" id="page_079"></a>{79}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, Madam,” he answered, “I trust that the chastening of the Lord may not
      have been in vain!”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, however, as far as any permanent change in the habits of the
      people was concerned. There was a brief interval of greater sobriety due
      to the sad plight of the community; then Sunday amusements resumed their
      sway with as much vigor as of old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although to the eye of the casual visitor the Capitol seems so quiet and
      well-ordered a place that it practically takes care of itself, the truth
      is that it is continually under pretty rigid surveillance. It has a
      uniformed corps of special police, whose jurisdiction covers everything
      within the limits of Capitol Park; besides this, the Superintendent of the
      Capitol has general oversight of the building, and the officers of the
      House and Senate look after their respective wings. When Thomas B. Reed of
      Maine became Speaker, he found the House wing a squatting ground for a
      small army of petty merchants who had crept in one by one and established
      booths for the sale of sandwiches and pies, cigars, periodicals, picture
      cards, and souvenirs, obstructing the highways of communication between
      one part of the building and another. He proceeded to sweep them all out.
      There was loud wailing among the ousted, and some who could command a
      little political influence brought it to bear on him, but in<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_080" id="page_080"></a>{80}</span> vain; and
      for more than twenty years thereafter the corridors remained free from
      these intruders. With the incoming of the Sixty-third Congress, however,
      discipline began to relax, and, unless the House acquires another Speaker
      with Mr. Reed’s notions of propriety and the force of will to compel
      obedience, we shall probably see the hucksters camping once more on the
      old trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of the building the rules are as well enforced as inside. When
      Coxey’s Army of the Commonweal marched upon Washington in 1894, its leader
      advertised his intention to make a speech from the Capitol steps, calling
      upon Congress to provide work and wages for all the idle laborers in the
      country. Under the law, no harangue or oration may be delivered anywhere
      on the Capitol grounds without the express consent of the presiding
      officers of the two chambers of Congress. Remembering the way the
      lawmakers had been intimidated by a mob at Philadelphia in the early days
      of the republic, neither the Speaker nor the President of the Senate was
      willing that Coxey should carry out his plan; and the Capitol police,
      without violence or display of temper, made short work of the proposed
      mass meeting. On another occasion, the performers for a moving-picture
      show attempted to use the steps of the Capitol as a background for a scene
      in which a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_081" id="page_081"></a>{81}</span>
      man made up to resemble the President of the United States was to play an
      undignified part; the police pounced down upon the company, confiscating
      the apparatus and escorting the actors to the nearest station-house. A
      like fate befel an automobilist who, on a wager, tried to drive his
      machine up the steps of the main portico. Occasionally a bicycler,
      ambitious to descend this staircase at full speed, has proved too
      quick-witted for the officers, but as a rule they are at hand when needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that we are outside, let us look around. To the eastward lies the part
      of the city broadly designated as Capitol Hill. As far as the eye can
      reach, it is a beautiful, evenly graded plateau&mdash;an ideal residence
      region as far as natural topography, verdure, sunshine, and pure air are
      concerned. It is the part which George Washington and other promoters of
      the federal city picked out for its residential end, and the Capitol was
      built so as to face it. These circumstances made it a favorite locality
      for speculative investment, and the prices at which early purchasers of
      land held out against later comers sealed its fate: the tide of favor
      turned toward the opposite end of the city, and the development of the
      northwest quarter took a start which has never since halted. The first
      plans of Capitol Park included on its eastern side a pretty<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_082" id="page_082"></a>{82}</span> little
      fish-pond, circular in shape, which must have been about where the two
      raised flower-beds with mottled marble copings now flank the driveway to
      First Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The west front of the Capitol overlooks a gentle slope pleasantly turfed
      and shaded. The building itself descends the slope a little way by an
      esplanade and a series of marble terraces, from which broad flights of
      steps lead down nearly to the main street level. The perspective view of
      the Capitol is much more impressive from this side than from the other,
      thanks to an admirable piece of landscape gardening. In old times, the
      lawns on the west side were used by the residents of the neighborhood for
      croquet grounds, and the whole park was enclosed in an iron fence, with
      gates that were shut by the watchmen at nine every evening against
      pedestrians, and at a somewhat later hour against carriages. With
      characteristic impatience of such restraints, sometimes a Congressman who
      had stayed at the Capitol past the closing hour would save himself the
      trouble of calling a guard to open the gate, by smashing the lock with a
      stone. The increasing frequency of such incidents undoubtedly had much to
      do with causing the removal of the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      No point in the city affords so fine facilities for fixing L’Enfant’s plan
      in the mind of the visitor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_083"
      id="page_083"></a>{83}</span> enabling him to find his way about the older
      parts of Washington, as the Capitol dome. A spiral staircase, the doors to
      which open from obscure parts of two corridors, leads first to the inside
      circular balcony crowning the rotunda. This is worth a few minutes’ delay
      to test its quality as a whispering gallery. The attendant in charge will
      show you how, and, if you can lure him into telling you some of the funny
      things he has seen and heard in his eyrie, you will be well repaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      More climbing will bring you to an outside perch, which forms a sort of
      collar for the lantern surmounting the dome. Now open a plainly printed
      map of Washington and hold it so that the points of the compass on the map
      correspond with those of the city below you. With a five minutes’ walk
      around the base of the lantern, to give you the view from every side, you
      will have mastered the whole scheme designed by L’Enfant. Here are the
      four quarters&mdash;northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest&mdash;as
      clearly spread before you on the surface of the earth as on the paper in
      your hand. Here is the Mall, with its grass and trees, leading up to the
      Washington Monument and abutting on the executive reservation where stand
      the White House, the Treasury, and the State, War and Navy Department
      buildings. Well out to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_084"
      id="page_084"></a>{84}</span> northward you can descry a tower which fixes
      the site of the Soldiers’ Home, and to the southward the Potomac, flowing
      past the War College and the Navy Yard. East of you loom up the hills of
      Anacostia. On all sides you see the lettered streets running east and
      west, intersected by the numbered streets running north and south, while,
      cutting both diagonally at various angles, but in pursuance of a
      systematic and easily grasped plan, are the avenues named in honor of the
      various States of the Union. Once let this chart fasten itself in your
      mind, and there is no reason why, total stranger though you may be, you
      should have any difficulty in finding your way about Washington.<span

    <p class="nind">
      <span class="letra">T</span>HE House of Representatives, albeit presenting
      an average of conduct equal to that of any corresponding chamber in the
      world, is a rough-and-tumble body. It is apt to carry partisan antagonisms
      to extremes and wrangle over anything that comes up, with accusations and
      recriminations, and at rare intervals an exchange of blows. Repeatedly I
      have seen the Sergeant-at-Arms lift his mace and march down one aisle and
      up another, to compose disturbances which seemed to threaten a sequel of
      riot, while the Speaker pounded his desk in an effort to overcome the
      clamor of several members trying to talk at once. By laxity of discipline
      and force of custom, there is a degree of freedom here, in even a peaceful
      discussion, unknown to the Senate. Members will bring, to exemplify their
      statements in a tariff debate, samples of merchandise&mdash;a suit of
      clothes, a basket of fruit, a jar of sweetmeats, perhaps. One day a
      debater, discussing olive oil, accidentally<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_086" id="page_086"></a>{86}</span> dropped a bottle of it on
      the floor, and several of his colleagues lost their footing in crossing
      the scene of the disaster. Another, who had a pocketful of matches
      designed for illustrative purposes, suddenly found his clothes ablaze and
      made a fiery bolt for a water-tank. Still another, inflamed by his own
      eloquence in trying to show how Congress ought to wring the life out of an
      odious monopoly, impetuously laid hands upon a small and inoffensive
      fellow member who happened to sit near and shook him till his teeth
      rattled, amid roars of delight from every one except the victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually, the Senate is as staid as the House is uproarious. All routine
      business is transacted there “by unanimous consent”; it is only when some
      really important issue arises that the Senators quarrel publicly. When a
      serious debate is on, there is no commotion: every Senator who wishes to
      speak sends his name to the presiding officer, or rises during a lull and
      announces his purpose of addressing the Senate on a specified day. The
      rest of the Senators respect his privilege, and, if he is a man of
      consequence, a goodly proportion of them will be in their seats to hear
      him. If a Senator is absent from the chamber when a matter arises which
      might concern him, some one is apt to suggest deferring its consideration
      till he can be present.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_087"
      id="page_087"></a>{87}</span> It is the same way with appointments to
      office which require confirmation by the Senate: a Senator objecting to a
      candidate nominated from his State can count upon abundant support from
      his fellow Senators, every one of whom realizes that it may be his turn
      next to need support in a similar contingency. This is what is called
      “Senatorial courtesy.” So well is it understood that no unfair advantage
      will be taken of any one’s absence, that the attendance in the chamber
      sometimes becomes very thin. An instance is often cited when the
      Vice-president, discovering only one person on the floor at the beginning
      of a day’s session, rapped with his gavel and solemnly announced: “The
      Senator from Massachusetts will be in order!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The strong contrast between the two chambers has existed ever since the
      creation of Congress. This is not wonderful when we reflect that the
      Senate was for a long time made up of men chosen by the State legislatures
      from a social class well removed from the masses of the people, and that
      they held office for a six-year term, thus lording it over the members of
      the House of Representatives, who, besides being drawn directly from the
      rank and file of the body politic, had to struggle for reëlection every
      two years. In the early days, the Senators were noted for their rich
      attire and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_088" id="page_088"></a>{88}</span>
      great gravity of manner; whereas most of the Representatives persisted,
      while sitting in the House during the debates, in wearing their big cocked
      hats set “fore and aft” on their heads. Whether the Senate sat covered or
      bareheaded for the first few years of its existence, we have only indirect
      evidence, as it then kept its doors closed against everybody, even members
      of the House. Little by little a more liberal spirit asserted itself,
      until the doors were opened to the public for a certain part of every
      morning, with the proviso that they should be closed whenever the subjects
      of discussion seemed to require secrecy. By common consent, these subjects
      were limited to certain classes of business proposed by the President,
      like the ratification of treaties and the confirmation of appointments to
      office. Such matters remain confidential to this day, and the Senate holds
      itself ready to exclude spectators and go into secret session at any
      moment, on the request of a single Senator.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a secret session is always supposed to be for the purpose of discussing
      a Presidential communication, the fiction is embalmed in the form of a
      motion “that the Senate proceed to the consideration of executive
      business.” This is the signal for the doorkeepers to evict the occupants
      of the galleries and shut the doors leading into the corridors; but
      sometimes the real<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_089" id="page_089"></a>{89}</span>
      reason for the request is widely removed from its pretext. I have known it
      to be offered for the purpose of cutting short the exhibition which a
      tipsy Senator was making of himself; or to prevent a tedious airing of
      grievances by a Senator who had quarreled with the President over the
      dispensation of patronage in his State; or to silence a Senator who,
      objecting to the negotiation of a certain treaty, kept referring to it in
      open debate while it was still pending under the seal of confidence. In
      this last instance, the offending Senator was so obstinate of purpose that
      the doors had to be closed and reopened several times in a single day.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the face of things, there is no reason why the President should not
      attend any session of the Senate at which business of his originating is
      under debate. No President since the first, however, has made the
      experiment. Washington attended three secret sessions, but was so angered
      by the Senate’s referring to a committee sundry questions which he
      insisted should be settled on the spot, that he quitted the chamber,
      emphatically vowing that he would waste no more time on such trifling. The
      Senators excused their conduct by saying that they were embarrassed in
      talking about the President and his motives while he was sitting there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The custom of wearing their hats while transacting<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_090" id="page_090"></a>{90}</span> business was continued by
      the Representatives for fifty years or more. Even the Speaker, as long as
      he sat in his chair, would keep his hat on, though he was accustomed to
      remove it when he stood to address the House. The Senators, whatever may
      have been their practice during the years of their seclusion,
      distinguished themselves from the Representatives immediately thereafter
      by sitting with bared heads. They also avoided the habit, common in the
      House, of putting their feet up on the nearest elevated object&mdash;usually
      a desk-lid&mdash;and lolling on their spines. English visitors, though
      accustomed to the wearing of hats in their own House of Commons,
      nevertheless found a text for criticism in the way the American
      Representatives did it; and they all had something severe to say of the
      prevalence of tobacco-chewing in the House, with its accompaniment of
      spitting, as Mrs. Trollope put it, “to an excess that decency forbids me
      to describe.” Less offensive to the taste of our visitors from abroad was
      the indulgence in snuff-taking, which was so general that boxes or jars
      were set up in convenient places inside of both halls, and it was made the
      duty of certain employees to keep these always filled with a fine brand of
      snuff. Any of the most eloquent orators in Congress was liable to stop at
      regular intervals in a speech to help himself to a large<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_091" id="page_091"></a>{91}</span> pinch,
      bury his face in a bandanna handkerchief, and have it out with nature. A
      few of the lawmakers, indeed, cultivated snuff-taking as a fine art, and
      were proud of their reputations for dexterity in it. Henry Clay was one of
      the most skilful.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we are on the subject of indulgences, we must not overlook a drink
      called switchel, which was very popular, being compounded of rum, ginger,
      molasses, and water. Every member was allowed then, as now, in addition to
      his salary and traveling expenses, a fixed supply of “stationery”; and
      this term, which was elastic enough to include everything from pens and
      paper to jack-knives and razors, was stretched to cover the delectable
      switchel under the thin disguise of “sirup.” In later years, when a wave
      of teetotalism had swept over Washington, and the open sale of alcoholic
      drinks in the restaurants of the Capitol was under a temporary ban, any
      member who wished a drink of whisky ordered it as “cold tea,” and it was
      served to him in a china cup. This stratagem fell into marked discredit
      when one of the most respectable and abstemious members of the House, who
      had never tasted intoxicating liquor of any sort, ordered cold tea in
      entire good faith to clear his throat in the midst of a speech, and became
      maudlin before he was aware that anything was amiss.<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_092" id="page_092"></a>{92}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides sprawling with their feet higher than their heads, and otherwise
      airing their contempt for conventional etiquette, many of the old-time
      Representatives felt free to read newspapers while debates were going on
      around them, indifferent to their disturbance of both orators and
      audience. The first pointed rebuke of this practice was administered by
      James K. Polk when Speaker of the House. He noticed one morning that
      substantially every Representative had a newspaper in hand when the gavel
      fell for beginning the day’s session. The journal was read, but nobody
      paid any attention to it, and then the Speaker made his usual announcement
      that the House was ready for business. Still everybody remained buried in
      the morning’s news. After another vain attempt to set the machinery in
      motion, Mr. Polk quietly drew a newspaper from his own pocket, seated
      himself with his back toward the House, spread the sheet open before him,
      and ostentatiously immersed himself in its printed contents. One by one
      the Representatives finished their reading, and perhaps a quarter of an
      hour passed before there came from all sides an irregular volley of calls:
      “Mr. Speaker!” “Mr. Speaker!” Mr. Polk ignored them till one of the
      baffled members moved that the House proceed to the election of a
      presiding officer, to take the place of the Speaker, who appeared<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_093" id="page_093"></a>{93}</span> to be
      absent. This brought Mr. Polk to his feet with the remark that he not only
      was present, but had notified the House that it was ready for business and
      had received no response. The House took the joke in good part and showed
      by its conduct thereafter that it was not above profiting by the Speaker’s
      reproof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although women were admitted as spectators to the sessions of both
      chambers on the same terms as men, there was for many years an
      undercurrent of feeling against their encroachments. There was limited
      room in either hall for their accommodation behind the colonnade. In this
      space&mdash;the original “lobby”&mdash;there was an open fireplace at each
      end, and it soon became a common complaint among the Senators that the
      feminine guests drew the sofas up in front of the fire and thus
      effectually shut off the warmth from every one else. Aaron Burr, while
      Vice-president, was the first person in authority to take cognizance of
      this indictment. He notified the visiting women that after a certain date
      they must cease coming into the lobby and find seats in the gallery. They
      were appropriately indignant and declared an almost unanimous boycott
      against the Senate. Vice-president Clinton was of a different temper from
      his predecessor and let them all come back again. By degrees, however, as
      the privileges of the floor became more and more restricted<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_094" id="page_094"></a>{94}</span> in both
      chambers, the women were given a special gallery for themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the time they began coming to Congress in any multitude, the fair
      visitors have made their presence felt. In the House one day John Randolph
      drew attention to them by halting a debate to point a long, skinny finger
      in their direction and snarl out: “Mr. Speaker, what, pray, are all these
      women doing here, so out of place in this arena? Sir, they had much better
      be at home attending to their knitting!” In spite of that, they continued
      to come and to attract attention, till the number of members who
      habitually quitted their seats to repair to the gallery and pay their
      devoirs to their lady friends threatened to play havoc with the
      roll-calls. This abuse did not last long, and nowadays the visit of a
      member of either house to the gallery is an incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far from objecting to spectators, both House and Senate now offer
      distinct encouragement to the public to come and hear the debates. To this
      end, each chamber has a deep gallery completely surrounding it, with cross
      partitions at intervals. One section is reserved for the President and
      Cabinet and their families; another for the members of the diplomatic
      circle; a third for the members of the press, and so forth. Control of
      each press gallery is nominally<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_095"
      id="page_095"></a>{95}</span> retained by the chamber concerned, but
      actually is left in the hands of a committee of newspaper men, who enforce
      an exemplary discipline, so that a writer guilty of misconduct would be
      excluded thenceforward from his privileges. On the other hand, the
      newspaper men have always stood firmly for their right to discuss the
      members and measures of Congress with all the freedom consonant with
      truth. It has required a long and sometimes dramatic struggle to bring
      about the present harmonious mutual understanding between Congress and the
      press as to the legitimate preserves of each body upon which the other
      must not trespass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the battles leading to this result are entertaining to recall. In
      the later forties, while members of the press were still permitted to do
      their work at desks on the floor of the House, a correspondent of the <i>New
      York Tribune</i> named Robinson published an article about a certain
      Representative named Sawyer, whose unappetizing personal habits he thought
      it would be wise to break up. Among other things he described the way
      Sawyer ate his luncheon: “Every day at two o’clock he feeds. About that
      hour he is seen leaving his seat and taking a position in the window back
      of the Speaker’s chair to the left. He unfolds a greasy paper, in which is
      contained a chunk of bread and sausage, or some other unctuous substance.
      He disposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_096" id="page_096"></a>{96}</span>
      of them rapidly, wipes his hands with the greasy paper for a napkin, and
      throws it out of the window. What little grease is left on his hands, he
      wipes on his almost bald head.” There was more to the same effect, but
      this will suffice. When the paper containing the article reached
      Washington, there was much laughing behind hands in Congress; but, though
      most of the members rejoiced that somebody should have told the truth for
      the dignity of the House, few had the courage to come out boldly and say
      that the satire was deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of Sawyer’s colleagues retaliated with a resolution that all writers
      for the <i>Tribune</i> be excluded thenceforward from the floor; after a
      brief debate it was adopted, and the offending correspondent was obliged
      to go up into the gallery and sit among the women. But his pursuers were
      not satisfied with this measure of revenge; for, reviving a half-forgotten
      rule that men were to be admitted to the gallery only when accompanied by
      women, and then must be passed in by a member of the House, they sent a
      doorkeeper to eject him even from his temporary refuge. At once several
      ladies volunteered to accompany him for his visits, and among the
      Congressmen who climbed the stairs from day to day to pass him in was one
      not less distinguished than John Quincy Adams. Nor<span class="pagenum"><a

      was this the end. For the correspondent went home, ran for Congress and
      was elected, while the wrathful Representative dropped into obscurity
      under the nickname, which he was never able to shake off, of “Sausage
      Sawyer.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Many newspaper publications have been made subjects of special
      investigation by committees of Congress, but in no instance has a threat
      of expulsion from the gallery or of prosecution in the courts produced any
      practical results; and the locking up of recusant committee witnesses has
      become a mere mockery. The most notable case on record was that of Hallet
      Kilbourn, a former journalist who had become a real estate broker and a
      leading participant in a local land syndicate which the House undertook to
      investigate. Kilbourn was commanded to produce certain account-books, as
      well as the names and addresses of sundry persons who, not being members
      of Congress, he insisted were outside the jurisdiction of that body. For
      his refusal to furnish the information demanded he was thrown into jail
      and kept there nearly six weeks. From the first, he had declared that he
      had no objection to opening his accounts to the whole world or to
      publishing the data desired, as all the transactions covered by the
      inquiry had been honorable; and this assertion he proved later by
      voluntarily printing<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_098" id="page_098"></a>{98}</span>
      everything. But he was resolved to make a legal test of the right of
      Congress to arrogate to itself the arbitrary powers of a court of justice,
      and he got a good deal of enjoyment out of the experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the whole period of his imprisonment he lived like a prince at the
      expense of the contingent fund of the House; drove about the city at will
      in a carriage, merely accompanied by a deputy sergeant-at-arms; and
      entertained his friends at dinner within the jail walls. Of course, the
      newspapers exploited the whole episode gladly, and when he had held his
      prosecutors up to popular ridicule long enough, he sued out a writ of
      habeas corpus and was released. Then he brought a suit for damages against
      the Sergeant-at-Arms for false imprisonment and won it on appeal after
      appeal, till the Supreme Court of the United States handed down a sweeping
      decision that “there is not found in the Constitution any general power
      vested in either house to punish for contempt.” In spite of the efforts of
      all the judges in the lower courts to cut down the damages granted by
      their juries, Congress was finally obliged to pay Kilbourn twenty thousand
      dollars, or about five hundred dollars a day for his forty days’
      incarceration. It took him nine years to carry his case through all its
      stages.

      Both chambers open their daily sessions with<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_099" id="page_099"></a>{99}</span> prayer. Clergymen of nearly
      all denominations have served as Chaplains, including Father Pise, a very
      eloquent Catholic priest who was a close friend of Henry Clay and was
      invited at his instance to lead the devotions of the Senate. As a rule,
      the prayers are extemporaneous, and it seems almost inevitable that, in
      periods of political upheaval, some color of partisanship should creep
      into them. Yet such slips have been very rare indeed. The most startling
      was made by the late Doctor Byron Sunderland, who was Chaplain of the
      Senate in 1862. He was the foremost Presbyterian minister in Washington
      and a strong anti-slavery advocate. One day Senator Saulsbury of Delaware,
      who was an accomplished biblical scholar, made a speech reviewing the
      references in the Hebrew scriptures to human servitude, as proof that
      slavery was of divine origin. Doctor Sunderland, having left the hall, did
      not hear the speech made, but was told about it when he arrived at the
      Capitol the next morning. He was nettled by the news, and, before he was
      fairly conscious of it, he caught himself saying something like this in
      his opening prayer: “Oh, Lord God of Nations, teach this Senate and all
      the people of this country that, if slavery is of divine institution, so
      is hell itself, and by Thy grace help us to abolish the one and escape the
      other!” These few words<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100"
      id="page_100"></a>{100}</span> caused a great sensation, and later in the
      day Mr. Saulsbury vented his indignation in a resolution to expel the
      offending clergyman from the chaplaincy; but some quick-witted Senator on
      the opposite side cut off debate by moving to adjourn, and the matter died
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day’s proceedings of Congress are published in a special journal
      called the <i>Record</i>; but it must not be too lightly assumed that
      every speech reported has been made in Congress. One of the rules of the
      House of Representatives permits a member, with the consent of the House,
      to be credited with having made remarks which, as a matter of fact, he has
      only reduced to writing and handed to the Clerk. That is what is meant by
      the “leave to print” privilege. Into the authorship of these speeches, or
      even of some that are delivered, it is not wise to probe too far. There
      are trained writers in Washington who earn a livelihood by digging out
      statistics and other data and composing addresses on various subjects for
      orators who are willing to pay for them, and Congressmen are among their
      customers. Once in a while something happens which casts a temporary
      shadow over this traffic. Several years ago, for example, two
      Representatives from Ohio were credited in the <i>Record</i> with the same
      speech. Inquiry developed the fact that it had been offered to one of
      them, who had refused either to pay the price<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_101" id="page_101"></a>{101}</span> demanded for it or to give
      it back; so the author had sold a duplicate copy to the other. But worse
      yet was the plight of two members who delivered almost identical eulogies
      on a dead fellow member, having by accident copied their material from the
      same ancient volume of “Rules and Models for Public Speaking.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I have alluded to disorders which occasionally mar the course of
      legislation, when members hurl ugly names at each other or even exchange
      blows. While some such affrays have carried their high tension to the end
      and sent the combatants to the dueling field to settle accounts, others
      have taken a comical turn which decidedly relaxed the strain. Perhaps the
      most picturesque incident of this kind was the historic Keitt-Grow contest
      in February, 1858. The House had been engaged all night in a wrangle over
      an acute phase of the slavery question, and two o’clock in the morning
      found both the Northern and the Southern members with their nerves on
      edge. Mr. Keitt of South Carolina, objecting to something said by Mr. Grow
      of Pennsylvania, struck at him, but Grow parried the blow, and a fellow
      member who sprang to his assistance knocked Keitt down. From all sides
      came reinforcements, and in a few minutes what started as a personal
      encounter of minor importance developed into a general free fight.<span

    <p>
      Potter of Wisconsin, a man of athletic build, whirled his fists right and
      left, doing tremendous execution. Owen Lovejoy, seeing Lamar of
      Mississippi striding toward a confused group, ran at him with arms
      extended, resolved on pushing him back, while Lamar as vigorously resisted
      the obstruction. Covode of Pennsylvania, fearing lest his friend Grow
      might be overpowered by hostile numbers, picked up a big stoneware
      spittoon and hurried forward, holding his improvised projectile poised to
      hurl at the head where it would do most good; but having no immediate need
      to use it, he set it on top of a convenient desk. Everybody was too
      excited to pay any attention to the loud pounding of the Speaker’s gavel,
      or to the advance of the Sergeant-at-Arms with his mace held aloft. Even
      the unemotional John Sherman and his gray-haired Quaker colleague Mott
      could not keep out of the fray entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Elihu Washburne of Illinois and his brother Cadwallader of Wisconsin
      proved by all odds the heroes of the occasion. They were of modest
      stature, but sturdy and full of energy. Elihu tackled Craig of North
      Carolina, who was tall and had long arms, which he swung about him with a
      flail-like motion; and it would have gone hard with the smaller man had he
      not suddenly lowered his head and used it as<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_103" id="page_103"></a>{103}</span> a battering-ram, aiming at
      the unprotected waist-line of his antagonist and doubling him up with one
      irresistible rush. Just then Cadwallader, seeing Barksdale of Mississippi
      about to strike Elihu, ran toward him; but being unable to penetrate the
      crowd, he leaped forward and reached over the heads of the intervening men
      to seize the Mississippian by the hair. Here came the culmination; for
      Barksdale’s ambrosial locks, which were only a lifelike wig worn to cover
      a pate as smooth as a soap-bubble, came off in his assailant’s hand. The
      astonishment of the one man and the consternation of the other were too
      much for the fighters, who, in spite of themselves, united in wild peals
      of merriment; and their hilarity was in no wise dampened when Barksdale,
      snatching at his wig, restored it to his head hind side before, or when
      Covode, returning to his seat and missing his spittoon, marched solemnly
      down the aisle and recovered it from its temporary perch.

      This scene occurred in the old Hall of Representatives. The most dramatic
      scene ever witnessed in the present hall was one which attended the
      opening of the Fifty-first Congress, when the Republicans, who had only an
      infinitesimal majority, had organized the House with Thomas B. Reed as
      Speaker. Reed, who was a large, blond man with a Shakespearian head<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_104" id="page_104"></a>{104}</span> and a
      high-pitched drawl, signalized his entrance upon his new duties by
      announcing his purpose to preside over a lawmaking rather than a
      do-nothing body. For several successive Congresses the House had found
      itself crippled in its attempts to transact business by the dilatory
      tactics of whichever party happened to be in the minority. Day after day,
      even in a congested season, would be wasted in roll-calls necessitated by
      some one’s raising the point of “no quorum,” although everybody knew that
      a quorum was present, and that its apparent absence was deliberately
      caused by the refusal of members of the opposition to answer to their
      names. Reed had bent his mind to breaking up this practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in his Speakership a motion to take up a contested election case was
      put to vote, and a roll-call demanded as usual by the minority. As the
      House was then constituted, one hundred and sixty-six members were
      necessary to a quorum, and four Republicans were unavoidably absent.
      Following the old tactics, nearly all the Democrats abstained from voting;
      but, as the call proceeded, Reed was observed making notes on a sheet of
      paper which lay on his table. At the close, he rose and announced the
      vote: yeas 162, nays 3, not voting 163. Mr. Crisp of Georgia at once
      raised the point of no quorum. Reed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105"
      id="page_105"></a>{105}</span> ignored it, and, lifting his memorandum,
      began, in measured tones and with no trace of excitement or weakness:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Chair directs the Clerk to record the following names of members
      present and refusing to vote&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Bedlam broke loose. The Republicans applauded, and howls and
      yells arose from the Democratic side. Above the din could be heard the
      voice of Crisp: “I appeal from the decision of the Chair!” But the
      Speaker, not having finished his statement, kept right on, oblivious of
      the turmoil:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mr. Blanchard, Mr. Bland, Mr. Blount, Mr. Breckinridge of Arkansas, Mr.
      Breckinridge of Kentucky&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Democrats generally had seemed stunned by the boldness of this move;
      but the Kentucky Breckinridge, at the mention of his name, rushed down the
      aisle, brandishing his fist and shaking his head so that its straight
      white hair stood out from it. His face was aflame with anger, and his
      voice quite beyond his control, as he shrieked: “I deny the power of the
      Speaker&mdash;this is revolutionary!” The other Democrats, inspired by his
      example and recovering from their stupefaction, poured into the center
      aisle. They bore down in a mass upon the Speaker’s dais, gesticulating
      wildly and all shouting at once, so that nothing<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_106" id="page_106"></a>{106}</span> could be understood from
      the babel of voices save their desire to express their scorn for the
      Speaker and their defiance of his authority. The Republicans sat quiet,
      making no demonstration, but obviously prepared to rush in if the trouble
      took on a more violent form. The Speaker stood apparently unruffled, not
      even changing color, and only those who were near enough to see every line
      in his face were aware of that slight twitching of the muscles of his
      mouth which always indicated that his outward composure was not due to
      insensibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      So furious was the clamor that he was compelled to desist from his reading
      for a moment, while he pounded with his gavel to command order on the
      floor. Then, as the remonstrants fell back a little, his nasal tone was
      heard again, still reciting that momentous list:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mr. Brookshire, Mr. Bullock, Mr. Bynum, Mr. Carlisle&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      And so on down the roll, one member after another jumping up when he heard
      his name called, but subsiding as the Speaker went imperturbably ahead,
      much as might a schoolmaster with a roomful of refractory pupils.
      Presently came the opportunity he had been waiting for. Mr. McCreary of
      Kentucky, a very dignified, decorous-mannered gentleman on<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_107" id="page_107"></a>{107}</span> ordinary
      occasions, had shown by his change of countenance and color that he was
      repressing his emotions with difficulty; and, resolved not to be ridden
      over ruthlessly as the rest had been, he had risen in his place and stood
      there, holding before him an open book and waiting to hear his name. The
      instant it was read out, he raised his disengaged hand and shouted: “Mr.
      Speaker!”
    </p>
    <p>
      To every one’s astonishment, the Speaker paused, turning a look of inquiry
      toward the interrupter, while the House held its breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I deny,” cried Mr. McCreary, in a voice which, in spite of his endeavor
      to be calm, was trembling with agitation, “your right to count me as
      present; and I desire to cite some parliamentary law in support of my
      point!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Reed, wearing an air of entire seriousness, answered with his familiar
      drawl:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Chair is making a statement of fact that the gentleman is present.”
      Then, with a significant emphasis on each word: “Does&mdash;the&mdash;gentleman&mdash;deny&mdash;it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence which had settled momentarily upon the chamber continued for a
      few seconds more, to be succeeded by an outburst of laughter which fairly
      shook the ceiling. The Republican side furnished most<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_108" id="page_108"></a>{108}</span> of it at first, but those
      Democrats who possessed a keen sense of humor soon gave way also. The
      Speaker, still grave as a statue, maintained the expectant attitude of one
      awaiting the reply to a question. McCreary held his ground for a few
      minutes, striving to make himself heard in reading a passage from his
      book, while the gavel beat a tattoo on the desk as if the Speaker were
      trying to aid him by restoring order; but he was talking against a
      torrent, and had to realize his defeat and resume his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the last name on the written list had been read, the Speaker handed
      the sheet to the Clerk for incorporation in the minutes, and, as coolly as
      if nothing had happened, proceeded to set forth briefly the precedents
      covering the case, including one ruling made by a very distinguished
      Democrat who was at that hour the most conspicuous candidate of his party
      for the Presidency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fight was resumed the next day and continued to rage all through the
      session, the foes of the Speaker constantly devising new stratagems to
      outwit him, but in vain. Sometimes there were funny little developments,
      as when, in a precipitate flight of the Democrats from the hall to escape
      being counted, Mr. O’Ferrall of Virginia inadvertently left his hat on his
      desk, and the Speaker jocosely threatened to count<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_109" id="page_109"></a>{109}</span>
    </p>
    <div class="figcenter" style="width: 454px;">

      that, on the theory that its habitual wearer was constructively present;
      or when “Buck” Kilgore, a giant Democrat from Texas, refused to stay in
      the hall after the Speaker had ordered the doors fastened, and kicked one
      of them open with his Number 14 boot. Sometimes a tragic threat would be
      uttered by a group of hot-headed enemies, and the galleries would be
      thronged for several days with spectators expecting to see Reed dragged
      out of the chair by force and arms. But, though every day witnessed its
      parliamentary struggle, the bad blood aroused was never actually spilled.
      What did happen was that, at the close of the Congress, when it is
      customary for the opposition party to move a vote of thanks to the
      Speaker, Reed went without the compliment. Something far more flattering
      than thanks was in store for him, however; for in the Fifty-third
      Congress, the House, which was then under Democratic control, by a vote of
      nearly five to one adopted his quorum-counting rule with only a technical
      modification. Since that day it has never found itself in a condition of
      legislative paralysis.

    <p>
      The communications in which the President, as required by the
      Constitution, gives to Congress from time to time “information of the
      state of the Union,” take the form of general and special messages. A
      general message is sent at the beginning of every session<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_110" id="page_110"></a>{110}</span> and
      usually reviews the relations of our Government with its citizens and with
      the outside world. A special message is called forth by some particular
      event or series of events requiring a union of counsels between the
      legislative and executive branches of the Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      The formalities attending the presentation of general messages have
      differed at various stages of our national history. John Adams, for
      example, brought his in person to the Capitol. A military and civic
      procession escorted him from his house to the Senate chamber, where the
      Senators and Representatives were assembled in joint session. He was
      attired with more elegance than was his wont and was accompanied by the
      members of his Cabinet, the United States Marshal acting as usher; the
      Vice-president surrendered to him the chair of honor and took a seat at
      his right while he read his address aloud. In those days, each house
      appointed a committee to consider the address of the President and to
      draft a reply to it; when the reply was ready, a committee waited upon him
      to inquire at what time it would be agreeable for him to receive it, and
      on the day appointed, the members called upon him in a body to present it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The message ceremonial was considerably shortened<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_111" id="page_111"></a>{111}</span> during the administration
      of President Jefferson, who scandalized some of the sticklers for
      propriety by reading his first address to Congress clad in a plain blue
      coat with gilt buttons, blue breeches, woolen stockings, and heavy shoes
      tied with leather strings. This democratic departure was typical of the
      way a good many old customs died out. We find most of the later
      Presidents, till the spring of 1913, rather studiously avoiding the
      Capitol, meeting Congress seldom outside of the White House, and confining
      their official communications to written messages presented in duplicate
      at the doors of the two halls respectively by the hand of an executive
      clerk. The response of each house, if any is deemed worth while, now takes
      the form of the introduction of legislation on lines suggested by the
      President. But the common practice is to cut a message into parts,
      referring the passages which deal with one class of subjects to one
      committee, and those which deal with another class to another committee;
      and in most cases, unless an emergency arises to make further
      consideration essential, little more is heard of them.
    </p>

      President Wilson has revived the custom of visiting Congress in its own
      home and there delivering his addresses directly to the lawmakers in a
      body, assembled for the occasion in the Hall of Representatives.<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_112" id="page_112"></a>{112}</span> This is
      a much more effective mode of approaching Congress than sending a written
      document by messenger, to be drawled through in a singsong voice by tired
      clerks, simultaneously in both halls, to a gathering of only
      half-interested auditors. It is also a more certain means of concentrating
      public attention upon the work of the session. There is a subtle something
      in the very personality of a President which appeals to the popular
      imagination. As the one high officer of state elected by the votes of all
      the people, he stands in their minds as a conservator and champion of
      their broadest ideals, as contrasted with the narrower sectional interests
      represented by the members of Congress. When, therefore, he takes his
      position face to face with the men who are to frame whatever legislation
      grows out of his recommendations, the whole country instinctively draws
      near and listens.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is hard to guess what might happen should it fall to the lot of
      President Wilson to appear before Congress in person with such a
      trumpet-call as was sounded in President Harrison’s message on the
      maltreatment of our sailors in Chile, or President Cleveland’s on the
      encroachments of England in Venezuela, or President McKinley’s on the
      failure of his peaceful efforts for freeing Cuba. If the mere reading of
      these formal messages was so impressive as to paint a vivid<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_113" id="page_113"></a>{113}</span> picture
      of the attendant scenes on the memory of all who witnessed them, what an
      extra touch of the dramatic would have been added had the chief executive
      of the nation appeared at the Capitol to tell his story himself!<span

    <h2>
      <a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br /><br /> <small>“THE
      OTHER END OF THE AVENUE”</small>
    </h2>
    <p class="nind">
      <span class="letra">A</span>LTHOUGH Pennsylvania Avenue is several miles
      long, the mile that lies between the hill on which Congress sits and the
      slope where the President lives is called in local parlance “the Avenue.”
      Outside of their formal speeches and documentary literature, members of
      Congress are wont to refer to the White House and its surroundings as “the
      other end of the Avenue.” This familiar phrase is, like the popular
      designation of Congress as “the gentlemen on the hill,” a survival from
      the period when only one hill in town was officially occupied, and the
      strip of highway connecting it with the group of buildings used by the
      executive branch of the Government was about the only thoroughfare making
      any serious pretensions to street improvement. It was along this line that
      President Jefferson planted the first shade trees; and L’Enfant’s plan
      made the south side of it the northern boundary of the Mall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The title which for almost a hundred years the American<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_115" id="page_115"></a>{115}</span> people
      have given to the headquarters of their chief public servant is a fine
      example of historic accident. The White House was not originally intended
      to be a white house. It was built of a buff sandstone which proved to be
      so affected by exposure to the weather that as an afterthought it was
      covered with a thick coat of white paint. From its nearness to several red
      brick buildings, many persons fell into the way of distinguishing it by
      its color, and after its repainting to conceal the stains of the fire of
      1814 this practice became general. Presidents have referred to it in their
      messages variously as the President’s House, the Executive Mansion, and
      the White House. Among the people it was also sometimes known, in the
      early days, as the Palace. The Roosevelt administration made the White
      House both the official and the social designation, and fastened the label
      so tight that there is little reason to expect a change by any successor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The White House was born under the eye of Martha Washington, was nursed
      into healthy babyhood by Abigail Adams, received its baptism of fire under
      Dolly Madison, was popularly christened under Eliza Kortright Monroe, and
      passed through numberless vicissitudes under a line of foster-mothers
      stretching from that time to the end of the century, every one carrying it
      a little further away from its original plan;<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_116" id="page_116"></a>{116}</span> then Edith Kermit Roosevelt
      administered a restorative elixir which started it upon a second youth.
      The evolution of the Capitol, described in an earlier chapter, finds a
      parallel in the architectural genesis of this building. Its drawings were
      made and its construction superintended by James Hoban, an Irishman; but a
      distinguished critic has described it as “designed on classic lines,
      modified by an English hand, at a time when French art furnished the
      world’s models in interior detail.” That accounts, of course, for its
      monumental and palatial features.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we must bear in mind that its sponsors intended it not only as an
      official residence for the executive head of the Government, but as a home
      for the foremost American citizen and his family, and that, in the
      esthetics of domestic architecture, local influences were most potent. All
      the Presidents except one, for the first thirty-six years of the
      republic’s existence, were Virginia gentlemen; so, although broadly
      following in treatment the Viceregal Lodge in Dublin, the President’s
      House took on much of the character of the “great house” on a Virginia
      plantation. This will explain why, in their work of restoration, when the
      architects were confronted by some gap in their plans which could not be
      filled by reference to the early records of the house itself, they drew
      upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_117" id="page_117"></a>{117}</span>
      material common to the Virginia mansions of the same period.
    </p>
    <p>
      By no means the least notable of their revivals was the recognition of the
      proper front of the building. For a half-century, and perhaps longer, its
      back door had been used as its main entrance, and most visitors had borne
      away the impression that that was the face its designer had intended it to
      present to the world. Nearly all the authoritative pictures helped to
      confirm this notion, by displaying the north side as confidently as the
      photographers in Venice take San Marco from the Piazza. The confusion of
      front and rear came about with other changes wrought by the increase of
      facilities for land transportation. The rural and suburban architecture of
      a century ago took great note of watercourses; for in those days wheeled
      vehicles were rarer than now and vastly less comfortable, the saddle was
      unsociable, and most travel was by river and canal. Hence the finest
      houses were built, when practicable, where they would not only command a
      pleasing view, but present their most picturesque aspect to the passing
      boats. Doubtless the site of the White House was chosen with reference to
      the bend which the Potomac made opposite the center of the building, thus
      opening a view down to Alexandria and beyond. The river was broader then,
      and probably washed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_118"
      id="page_118"></a>{118}</span> outer edge of what was intended to be
      preserved forever as the President’s Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the growing preference for land approaches, a good many Southern
      houses of the colonial type altered their habits, the White House among
      them; the side which faced the street offered the easier entrance, and
      thus the back door gradually usurped the dignities of the front, and
      accordingly the grounds on that side were laid out with lawns, trees, and
      shrubbery. Its outlook, also, is upon Lafayette Park, which, if sundry
      plans are carried through, will one day be faced on three sides with
      stately buildings, housing those executive Departments with which the
      President has to keep in closest touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though President Washington was never to occupy the White House, or even
      to see it after it was nearly enough finished for occupancy, he took the
      greatest interest in watching it go up, and, only a few weeks before his
      death, went all over it with Mrs. Washington, thoroughly inspecting every
      part then accessible. He had borne a share in the Masonic ceremony of
      laying its corner-stone, and by his personal influence had induced the
      State of Virginia to advance a large sum of money at one particularly
      critical stage of the building operations; so the old mansion may boast of
      having some honored association with every President<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_119" id="page_119"></a>{119}</span> from the foundation of our
      Government till now.
    </p>
    <p>
      When John and Abigail Adams moved in, the scantiness of fuel and lights,
      and the necessity for devoting the east room to the humblest of domestic
      uses and converting an upstairs chamber into a salon, were not the only
      shortcomings in their environment. Surface drainage water from a
      considerable bit of high ground to the eastward had formed a turbid little
      creek which almost surrounded the mansion. There was no water fit to drink
      and of sufficient quantity to meet the daily needs of the President’s
      family, short of a spring in an open tract which we now know as Franklin
      Square, about half a mile away, whence it was brought down in crude pipes.
      Beds of growing vegetables filled parts of the garden area where to-day we
      find well-kept lawns and ornamental shrubbery. The only way of reaching
      the south door from Pennsylvania Avenue was by a narrow footpath, on which
      the pedestrian took a variety of chances after dark. The streets
      surrounding the President’s grounds were so deep in slush or mud for a
      large part of the year that, in order to keep their clothing fairly
      presentable, visitors were obliged to come in closed coaches; and when the
      Adamses gave their first New Year’s reception, their guests, though so few
      that the oval room in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_120" id="page_120"></a>{120}</span>
      the second story accommodated them, could not obtain in Washington enough
      suitable vehicles, and had to draw upon the livery stables in Baltimore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adams was a well-bred and well-read man, reared in the best traditions of
      New England, including the sanctity of a pledge; and, having promised his
      friend and predecessor, Washington, to do what he could toward building up
      a capital in fact as well as in name, he pocketed his petty discomforts
      and made the best of things. Among his other efforts to promote the
      popularity of the new city must be counted several dinners of exceptional
      excellence, at which Mrs. Adams presided with distinguished graciousness
      in a costume that, though it would strike us now as rather prim, was in
      keeping with her age and antecedents. The President, who was a rotund,
      florid man of middle height, appeared at these entertainments in a richly
      embroidered coat, silk stockings, shoes with huge silver buckles, and a
      powdered wig. These were concessions to the general demand for elegance of
      attire on the part of the chief magistrate, following the precedent
      established by Washington. They did not at all reflect Mr. Adams’s
      preferences, for he was one of the plainest of men in his tastes, and his
      ordinary course of domestic life in the President’s House was to the last
      degree unpretentious; his luncheon, for example,<span class="pagenum"><a

      consisted usually of oatcake and lemonade, and one of his amusements was
      to play horse with a little grandchild, who used to drive him up and down
      the somber corridors with a switch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albeit Adams and Jefferson became, late in life, the warmest of friends,
      no love was lost between them during the period when both were active in
      politics. Adams, who would have been gratified to receive, like
      Washington, a second term, was not disposed to “enact the captive chief in
      the procession of the victor,” so he did not stay to see Jefferson
      inaugurated, but at daylight of the fourth of March, 1801, left Washington
      for Boston. There was no need for such haste to escape, for Jefferson, as
      the high priest of democratic simplicity, had no procession; though the
      cheerful little fiction about his riding down Pennsylvania Avenue alone,
      and hitching his horse to a sapling in front of the Capitol while he went
      in to be sworn, received its death-blow long ago. The truth is, he had no
      use for a horse. He was boarding in New Jersey Avenue, where he had lived
      for the latter part of his term as Vice-president. A few minutes before
      noon on inauguration day he set out on foot, in company with several
      Congressmen who were his fellow boarders, and walked the block or so to
      the Capitol, where he was escorted by a committee to the Senate chamber
      and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_122" id="page_122"></a>{122}</span>
      there took the oath of office and delivered his address. Then he walked
      back again to his boarding-house, and at dinner occupied his customary
      seat at the foot of the table. A visitor from Baltimore complimented him
      on his address and “wished him joy” as President. “I should advise you,”
      was his smiling response, “to follow my example on nuptial occasions, when
      I always tell the bridegroom that I will wait till the end of the year
      before offering my congratulations.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The accommodations in the President’s House were somewhat better by the
      time Mr. Jefferson moved in than they were when the Adams family opened
      it, yet he seems to have been more or less cramped during most of his two
      terms&mdash;owing, doubtless, to the continued presence of mechanics and
      building materials in the incomplete parts of the house. When the British
      Minister called in court costume to present his credentials, he was
      received, with his convoy the Secretary of State, in a space so narrow
      that he had to back out of one end of it to make room for the President to
      enter at the other. One of the legation described Jefferson as “a tall
      man, with a very red, freckled face and gray, neglected hair; his manners
      were good natured and rather friendly, though he had somewhat of a cynical
      expression of countenance. He wore a blue coat, a thick, gray-colored
      hairy waistcoat<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_123" id="page_123"></a>{123}</span>
      with a red under-waistcoat lapped over it, green velveteen breeches with
      pearl buttons, yarn stockings with slippers down at the heels, his
      appearance being very much like that of a tall, raw-boned farmer.” On the
      other hand, an admiring contemporary insists that his dress was “plain,
      unstudied and sometimes old-fashioned in its form,” but “always of the
      finest materials,” and that “in his personal habits he was fastidious and
      neat.” So there you are!
    </p>
    <p>
      A social being Jefferson certainly was. He liked company, and his former
      residence in France had cultivated his taste for the good things of the
      table, including light wines and olives. He once said that he considered
      olives the most precious gift of heaven to man, and he had them on his
      table whenever he could get them. He was also fond of figs and mulberries,
      and his household records bristle with purchases of crabs, pineapples,
      oysters, venison, partridges, and oranges&mdash;a pretty fair list for a
      man devoted to plain living. One of his hobbies as a host at very small
      and confidential dinners was to insure to his guests the utmost privacy,
      so he devised a scheme for dispensing as far as practicable with the
      presence of servants and avoiding the needless opening and closing of
      doors. Beside every chair was placed a small “dumb-waiter” containing all
      the desirable accessories, like fresh plates<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_124" id="page_124"></a>{124}</span> and knives and forks and
      finger-bowls; while in a partition wall was hung a bank of circular
      shelves, so pivoted as to reverse itself at the pressure of a spring, the
      fresh viands entering the dining-room as the emptied platters swung around
      into the pantry. The company at table rarely exceeded four when this
      machinery was called into play. At big state dinners the usual array of
      servants did the waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first great reception in Jefferson’s administration occurred on the
      fourth of July next following his inauguration. For some reason, possibly
      because the novelty of his sweeping invitation prevented its being
      generally understood by the populace, only about one hundred persons
      presented themselves. A luncheon was served, in the midst of which the
      Marine Band entered, playing the “President’s March,” or, as we call it,
      “Hail Columbia.” The company fell in behind and joined in a grand
      promenade, with many evolutions, through the rooms and corridors of the
      ground floor, returning at last to the place whence they had started and
      resuming their feast of good things.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was a widower when he succeeded Adams at the head of the Government,
      and it was not feasible, most of the time, for either of his daughters to
      preside over his public hospitalities, Jefferson naturally turned for aid
      to Mrs. James Madison, wife of his Secretary of<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_125" id="page_125"></a>{125}</span> State. He despised empty
      precedent; and when, at a diplomatic dinner, he led the way to the
      dining-room with Mrs. Madison instead of offering his arm to Mrs. Merry,
      wife of the British Minister and dean of the corps, he defied all the
      old-world canons. Mrs. Merry withdrew in high dudgeon, and her husband
      made the incident the subject of a communication to the Foreign Office in
      London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolly Madison’s fondness for society counterbalanced the indifference of
      her husband&mdash;a little, apple-faced man with a large brain and
      pleasant manners but no presence, of whom every one spoke by his nickname,
      “Jemmy.” She is described as a “fine, portly, buxom dame” with plenty of
      brisk small-talk. She knew little of books, but made a point of having one
      in her hand when she received guests who were given to literature; and she
      would have peeped enough into it to enable her to open conversation with a
      reference to something she had found there. One of the celebrities she
      entertained was Humboldt, the scientist, concerning whom she wrote: “We
      have lately had a great treat in the company of a charming Prussian baron.
      All the ladies say they are in love with him. He is the most polite,
      modest, well-informed, and interesting traveler we have ever met, and is
      much pleased with America.” Another was Tom Moore, who, though<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_126" id="page_126"></a>{126}</span>
      embalming in verse some of the spiteful spirit he had absorbed from the
      Merrys, in later years recanted these utterances.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she was praised everywhere for the beauty of her complexion, it is
      disconcerting to learn from a candid biographer that Mrs. Madison was wont
      to heighten her color by external applications, and now and then, through
      an accident of the toilet, gave to her nose a rosy flush that was meant
      for her cheeks. We are told also that she was addicted to the fashionable
      snuff habit and kept always at hand a dainty little box made of platinum
      and lava, filled with her favorite brand of “Scotch,” which she would
      freely use at social gatherings and then pass around the circle of
      diplomatists who assiduously danced attendance upon her. This indulgence
      accounted for her carrying everywhere two handkerchiefs: one a bandanna
      tucked away in her sleeve, whence she could draw it promptly for what she
      called “rough work,” and the other a spider-web creation of lawn and lace,
      which she styled her “polisher” and wore pinned to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the British Minister with his standing grievance, which he
      advertised by never bringing Mrs. Merry to the President’s House after the
      fateful dinner, we read of two other foreign envoys who used to<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_127" id="page_127"></a>{127}</span> appear
      there spouseless. One was Sidi Mellanelli, who, Dr. Samuel Mitchill tells
      us, “came from Tunis to settle some differences between that regency and
      our Government. He is to all appearance upward of fifty years old; wears
      his beard and shaves his head after the manner of his country, and wears a
      turban instead of a hat. His dress consists simply of a short jacket,
      large, loose drawers, stockings, and slippers. When he goes abroad he
      throws a large hooded cloak over these garments; it is of a peculiar cut
      and is called a bernous. The colors of his drawers and bernous are
      commonly red. He seldom walks, but almost always appears on horseback. He
      is a rigid Mohammedan; he fasts, prays, and observes the precepts of the
      Koran. He talks much with the ladies, says he often thinks about his
      consort in Africa, and wonders how Congressmen can live a whole session
      without their wives.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The other unaccompanied diplomat was the French Minister, General Turreau,
      a man of humble birth who had risen to some eminence during the recent
      revolution in his country. Having once been imprisoned, he improved the
      opportunity to make love to his jailer’s daughter and marry her; but he
      appears to have tired of his bargain, and it was no secret that they led a
      most inharmonious life. According to Sir Augustus Foster, he was in the
      habit of horsewhipping<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_128"
      id="page_128"></a>{128}</span> her to the accompaniment of a violoncello
      played by his secretary to drown her cries, and the scandalized neighbors
      had finally to interfere. Doctor Mitchill’s version of the affair is that
      the Minister tried to send his wife back to France, and that, when she
      refused to leave and raised an outcry, a mob gathered at their house and
      enabled her to escape and go to live in peaceful poverty in Georgetown.
      The Doctor has little to say of Turreau’s ability, but dwells impressively
      on “the uncommon size and extent of his whiskers, which cover the greater
      part of his cheeks,” and on the profusion of lace with which his
      full-dress coat was decorated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerome Bonaparte, a younger brother of the first Napoleon, passed a good
      deal of time in Washington during the Jefferson administration and was one
      of the lions at the parties in the President’s House. Meeting Miss
      Elizabeth Patterson of Baltimore, he succumbed to her attractions and lost
      no time in suing for her hand. Her father was a bank president and one of
      the richest men in the United States, and the family, whose social
      position was unexceptionable, were far from having their heads turned by
      the proposed match, possibly feeling some misgivings as to future
      complications; but the young people would listen to no argument and were
      married. Mr. Jefferson<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_129"
      id="page_129"></a>{129}</span> wrote at once to the American Minister at
      Paris, telling him to lay all the facts before the First Consul and to
      make it plain that in the United States any marriage was lawful which had
      been voluntarily entered into by two single parties of full age.
      Nevertheless, the great Napoleon did not hesitate to treat the marriage as
      void, and Jerome lacked manliness to defy his brother and fight the matter
      out; but Mrs. Bonaparte, having spunk enough for two, stood up firmly for
      her rights as a wife to the end of her days, and commanded recognition for
      them everywhere outside of the imperial court.

    <p>
      A friend of Jefferson’s who came to Washington during his administration,
      and whose advent created not a little stir, was a man about seventy years
      of age, described as having “a red and rugged face which looks as if he
      had been much hackneyed in the service of the world,” eyes “black and
      lively,” a nose “somewhat aquiline and pointing downward” which
      “corresponds in color with the fiery appearance of his cheeks,” and a
      marked fondness for talk and anecdote. This was none other than Tom Paine,
      patriot, poet, political pamphleteer, and infidel. He was favorably
      remembered all over the United States for his writings in behalf of human
      rights, and for the leaflets and songs which had cheered the hearts of the
      Continental soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_130" id="page_130"></a>{130}</span>
      at the most discouraging pass in our War for Independence. After the
      Revolution, he had gone abroad as an apostle of popular liberty, and,
      though outlawed in England, had been permitted to cross to France to take
      his seat as a deputy in the proletariat National Assembly. There, among
      other acts which won him commendation, he raised his voice and cast his
      vote against the resolution which sent Louis XVI to the guillotine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Appreciating his services to this country and also strongly sympathizing
      with the French type of democracy, Jefferson had invited Paine to come
      back to his native land in a United States war-ship; and the Federalist
      newspapers seized their chance to make partisan capital by parading
      Paine’s religious heterodoxy and charging Jefferson with having brought
      him home to undermine the morals of our people. Jefferson had considerable
      difficulty in counteracting the effects of the accusation, for his own
      opinions had been for a good while under fire, and it was not a day of
      nice distinctions. Probably in this more tolerant age a man like Paine
      would be given due credit for his practical benevolence even when mixed
      with a hatred of ecclesiasticism, and Jefferson would find himself not out
      of place in the Unitarian fold.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jefferson was not occupied with affairs of state<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_131" id="page_131"></a>{131}</span> or entertaining visitors,
      he was fond of sitting in what he called his “cabinet”&mdash;a room which
      he had fitted up to suit his own fancy. The rest of the house was rather
      unhomelike. The east room was still unfinished, and through the others
      were strewn articles of furniture which, though good in their way, were
      not especially suggestive of comfort; many of them were relics of the
      Washington régime, brought from Philadelphia. But in the cabinet stood a
      long table with drawers on each side, filled with things dear to their
      owner’s heart. One contained books with inscriptions from their authors;
      another, letters and manuscripts; a third, a set of carpenter’s tools for
      his amusement on rainy days; a fourth, some small gardening implements,
      and so on. Around the walls were maps, charts, and shelves laden with
      standard literature. Flowers and potted plants were everywhere, and in the
      midst of a bower of these hung the cage of his pet mockingbird; but the
      door of the cage was rarely shut when the President was in the room, for
      he loved to have the bird fly about freely, perch on his shoulder, and
      take its food from his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      As may be guessed, the sponsor for this greenery was fond of all growing
      things. Jefferson was often seen walking about the embryo city, watching
      the workmen digging or building, but manifesting a special<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_132" id="page_132"></a>{132}</span> interest
      in tree-planting and ornamental gardening. He tried to induce Congress to
      vote enough money to beautify the grounds around the President’s House,
      but in vain; the most he could do was to enclose the yard with a common
      stone wall and seed it down to grass. Among the plans he prepared but was
      obliged to abandon was the adornment of these grounds exclusively with
      trees, shrubs, and flowers indigenous to American soil. He must be
      credited with the first attempt ever made in Washington to establish a
      zoölogical park; Lewis and Clarke, the explorers, brought him from the
      West a few grizzly bears, for which he built a pen in the yard. He also
      made the first move to furnish Pennsylvania Avenue with shade trees. His
      preference was for willow-oaks; but he started four rows of Lombardy
      poplars to take advantage of their rapid growth till the slower oaks
      matured. One of his hobbies was to improve the market gardening of the
      neighborhood by distributing new varieties of vegetable seeds obtained
      through the American consuls in foreign countries, and instructing his
      steward always to buy the best home-grown table delicacies at the highest
      retail prices.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Madison’s inauguration in 1809, Jefferson not only did not imitate the
      ungraciousness of Adams eight years before, but went to the opposite
      extreme, declining<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_133" id="page_133"></a>{133}</span>

    <p>
      Madison’s invitation to drive to the Capitol in the Presidential coach
      lest he might divide the honors which he felt belonged exclusively to the
      President-elect. Madison had what was then deemed a wonderful procession
      of military and civic organizations, and turned the occasion into the
      first “made-in-America” gala day, wearing himself a complete suit of
      clothing made by an American tailor, of cloth woven on American looms from
      the wool of American sheep. Jefferson, clad in one like it, modestly
      waited till the procession had passed and then rode to the Capitol alone,
      not even a servant following to care for his horse. On entering the Hall
      of Representatives, he declined the chair reserved for him near Madison’s
      but joined the ordinary spectators, saying: “To-day I return to the
      people, and my proper seat is among them.” At the close of the ceremony,
      he mounted his horse again and rode up the Avenue unattended, till George
      Custis, also mounted, joined him, and they went together to the Madisons’
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here a crowd of friends had gathered to welcome in the new administration.
      Mr. Madison’s emotions had been a good deal stirred by what had passed at
      the Capitol, but his manner was affable. His wife was all herself as
      usual. She was attired in a plain cambric dress with a very long train,
      and a bonnet of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_134" id="page_134"></a>{134}</span>
      purple velvet and white satin, adorned with white plumes. Jefferson seems
      to have been, for such time as he stayed, quite as much the lion of the
      occasion as his successor. Presently he slipped quietly away and went over
      to the President’s House, where the empty halls echoed to his footsteps;
      for he had given all the servants a holiday so that they could see the
      show. But he did not remain long alone; the news spread among his old
      friends that he had gone back to bid his home of eight years farewell, and
      they followed him after a little. In the evening he went to the inaugural
      ball&mdash;the first ever held, and the only ball of any sort he had
      attended since his return from France.
    </p>
    <p>
      From all accounts it was not a highly enjoyable affair. The room was so
      crowded that it was difficult to elbow one’s way across it; nobody could
      see what was going on without standing on a chair; the air became
      stifling, and when an attempt was made to freshen it by letting down the
      upper sashes of the windows, they would not move, so nothing was left but
      to smash the glass. Mrs. Madison was almost crushed to death; Madison was
      so tired that he confessed to a friend that he wished he were abed; and as
      soon as supper was over, the Presidential party withdrew. The younger set
      stayed and danced till midnight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_135"
      id="page_135"></a>{135}</span> when, at the stroke, the music ceased and
      the attendants began to put out the lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      The social success achieved by Dolly Madison as official hostess through
      so large a part of Jefferson’s administration did not wane when, with the
      rise of her husband to the head of the Government, she came into her own
      by right instead of by courtesy. Her first term as mistress of the
      President’s House was a continuous blaze of gayety, in which we catch
      fleeting glimpses of her in a variety of toilets, the most truly typical
      being a buff velvet gown with pearl ornaments and a Paris turban topped
      with a bird-of-paradise plume. Then came the second war with Great Britain
      and the wrecking of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the British approached Bladensburg, and the improvised home-guard of
      Washington went out to engage them in battle, Mr. Madison permitted his
      military advisers to persuade him that, after seeing the stiffness of the
      American resistance, the British would withdraw. His wife caught the
      infection of confidence, and together they planned to celebrate the
      victory by a dinner to the officers on the evening after the battle. The
      table was spread by three in the afternoon, when Mrs. Madison, who had
      been listening with composure to the distant boom of cannon, was dismayed
      to see a lot of demoralized American soldiers running in from<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_136" id="page_136"></a>{136}</span> the
      north by twos and threes. Her sudden fears were confirmed when one of her
      colored servants galloped up to the door, shouting: “Clear out! Clear out!
      General Armstrong has ordered a retreat!” Then a few friends came over to
      insist on her seeking safety in flight. They helped her to fill a wagon
      with such valuables as were not too heavy; but she provoked their
      indignation by waiting till the oil portrait of General Washington
      attributed to Stuart, which hangs in the White House to-day, could be cut
      out of its frame and “placed in the hands of two gentlemen from New York
      for safe keeping.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We have already seen how the Capitol and other public buildings were
      burned. A particularly vicious scheme was worked out to assure the
      destruction of the President’s House, because of Mr. Madison’s personal
      share in the dispute which led to the war. Indeed, it was the hope of the
      invaders to find him and his wife at home and take them captive, so as to
      humiliate the American Government and people and thus impress a lesson for
      the future. By way of a reconnoiter, Admiral Cockburn went to the mansion
      and looked through it, taking with him as a hostage a young gentleman of
      the city, named Weightman. In the dining-room they found everything
      prepared for the dinner of triumph, and Cockburn ordered his companion<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_137" id="page_137"></a>{137}</span> to sit
      down with him and “drink Jemmy’s health.” Then he bade Weightman help
      himself to a mantel ornament as a souvenir of the day. “I must take
      something, too,” he added, and with great hilarity tucked under his arm an
      old hat of the President’s and a cushion from Mrs. Madison’s chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all was ready, a detachment of fifty sailors and marines were marched
      in silence up Pennsylvania Avenue, every man carrying a long pole with a
      ball of combustible material attached to the top of it. Arrived at the
      mansion, the balls were lighted, and the poles rested each against a
      window. At a command from their officer, the pole-bearers struck their
      windows simultaneously a hard blow, smashing the glass and hurling the
      fire-balls into the rooms with a single motion; and the little group of
      lookers-on beheld an outburst of flame from every part of the building at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Octagon House, where they passed some months after their return to
      Washington, the Madisons were surrounded by the same friends who had
      enjoyed the hospitalities of the President’s House before the fire. It was
      not, however, till they removed to the dwelling at the corner of
      Pennsylvania Avenue and Nineteenth Street that Mrs. Madison was able to
      entertain on the scale she desired. The house was<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_138" id="page_138"></a>{138}</span> one of the most commodious
      in town, and for any fine function the whole of it was thrown open. This
      was done on the occasion of the levee of February, 1816, which was
      universally pronounced the most splendid witnessed in the United States up
      to that time. The illumination extended from garret to cellar, much of it
      coming from pine torches held aloft by slaves specially drilled to
      maintain statuesque attitudes against the walls and at the heads of
      staircases. Mrs. Madison’s toilet of rose-tinted satin was set off with a
      girdle, necklace, and bracelets of gold, and a gold-embroidered crown. It
      may have been this last adornment which suggested to Sir George Bagot, the
      new British Minister, his comment that “Mrs. Madison looks every inch a
      queen.” The compliment promptly spread over Washington, where for some
      time thereafter the President’s wife was constantly referred to as “the
      Queen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This levee was in the nature of a farewell, for on the fourth of the next
      month President Madison made way for his successor, James Monroe, whose
      inauguration was the first ever held in the open air. The innovation was
      due to a quarrel between the two chambers of Congress, which was then
      occupying its temporary quarters opposite the east grounds of the Capitol.
      Monroe had arranged to take the oath in the<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_139" id="page_139"></a>{139}</span> Hall of Representatives;
      but the Senators found fault with the seats set apart for them, the
      Representatives were stubborn, and a deadlock seemed imminent, when Monroe
      suggested as a compromise that a platform be raised in front of the
      building, and that the ceremony take place there, where all the people
      could witness it. Thus began what came to be known as “the era of good
      feeling.”
    </p>
    <p>
      How class consciousness prevailed in those days is amusingly illustrated
      by Monroe’s resentment of the foreign conception of Americans. “People in
      Europe,” he had once said to the French Minister, while Secretary of State
      under Madison, “suppose us to be merchants occupied exclusively with
      pepper and ginger. They are much deceived. The immense majority of our
      citizens do not belong to this class, and are, as much as your Europeans,
      controlled by principles of honor and dignity. I never knew what trade
      was; the President was as much a stranger to it as I.” Perhaps it was
      because he knew so little about trade that he took pains to cultivate its
      acquaintance as soon as he became President. He made a grand tour of the
      new West, staying away from Washington more than four months and visiting
      especially the commercial centers, where he showed himself to the people
      as much as possible. He invited some criticism by making his<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_140" id="page_140"></a>{140}</span> tour in
      the buff-and-blue uniform of the Continental soldiery of forty years
      before, cocked hat and all; but his friends always contended that this
      appeal to patriotism vastly increased his popularity and went far to
      account for his wonderful success in his campaign for reëlection in 1820,
      when he captured all the electoral votes except one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The period covered by the last few pages brought to Washington two great
      men, whose share in shaping the history of the United States was such as
      to warrant our pausing to take a closer look at them. These were Henry
      Clay and Daniel Webster. Clay was probably the most popular man in our
      public life from Washington’s time to Lincoln’s, and his legislative
      career was unique both in its beginning and in its ending. He came to
      Washington first to fill a vacancy caused by the death of a Kentucky
      Senator, and held this position for several months while he was still too
      young to be eligible under the Constitution, because nobody was disposed
      to inquire into the years of one who possessed so mature a mind. Both
      before and after this experience he served in the Kentucky legislature,
      where, on account of an insult received in debate, he challenged its
      author and “winged” him in a duel. When the Twelfth Congress was about to
      meet, with every prospect that John Randolph and<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_141" id="page_141"></a>{141}</span> his little coterie were
      going to make trouble in the House, a demand arose for a Speaker who would
      be able to cope with the turbulent element. Clay had just been elected a
      Representative, and his prowess as a duelist drew all eyes in his
      direction. “Harry Clay can keep Randolph in order,” declared his Kentucky
      neighbors, “and he is the only man who can!” On this ground, then, he was
      elected Speaker before he had actually taken his seat in the House. He was
      the first man ever thus honored; and he was, I believe, the only one who
      ever made two formal farewells to the Senate. The first, preliminary to
      his resignation in 1842, appears among the classics of American eloquence;
      but, as he was sent back in 1849, he had the chance, rarely accorded any
      one except a histrionic star, to bow himself off the stage a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the years of his greatest activity, every announcement that he was
      to speak made a gala day at the Capitol. “The gallery was full,” wrote
      Margaret Bayard Smith of one such occasion, “to a degree that endangered
      it; even the outer entries were thronged. The gentlemen are grown very
      gallant and attentive, and, as it was impossible to reach the ladies
      through the gallery, a new mode was invented for supplying them with
      oranges, etc. They tied them up in handkerchiefs, to each of which was
      fixed a note<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_142" id="page_142"></a>{142}</span>
      indicating for whom it was designed, and then fastened to a long pole.
      This was taken on the floor of the house and handed up to the ladies who
      sat in the front of the gallery. These presentations were frequent and
      quite amusing, even in the midst of Mr. Clay’s speech. I and the ladies
      near me divided what was brought with each other, and were as social as if
      acquainted.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The orator who could hold his own against such a background of confusion
      might well take pride in his powers; but the universal testimony was that
      Clay’s wonderfully modulated voice and magnetic charm of personality
      triumphed over everything. He was so attractive a man that even Calhoun,
      with whom he was at swords-drawn in every forensic battle, could not
      forbear wringing his hand with a “God bless you!” at their final parting
      in the Senate chamber; and John Randolph, with whom he had clashed
      repeatedly and whose coat he had punctured in a duel, insisted on being
      carried to the Capitol, while dying, and laid on a couch where Clay was
      going to deliver a much-heralded speech. Possibly one of the secrets of
      Clay’s success in winning people was illustrated in his quarrel with
      Senator King of Alabama, which began on the Senate floor and led to the
      passage of a challenge. Friends interfered, and after some days a peace
      was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_143" id="page_143"></a>{143}</span>

      patched up, both men publicly withdrawing their offensive remarks, and a
      brother Senator making some appropriate gratulatory observations on the
      reconciliation. Then Clay gave the final dramatic touch to the scene by
      crossing the chamber to where his late adversary sat, saying aloud: “King,
      give me a pinch of your snuff!” King, surprised, sprang up and held out
      both a snuff-box and an open hand, while Senators and spectators applauded
      to the echo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clay was a slimly built man who always appeared for action clad in a
      solemn suit of black, with a claw-hammer coat, a stiff silk stock, and a
      huge white “choker” with pointed ears. His face was spare and his forehead
      high, his cheekbones were prominent, the nose between them was slender and
      forceful, and the mouth wide, thin-lipped, and straight-cut. His lank
      hair, naturally of a tawny hue, became early streaked with gray and was
      worn long enough to fringe his coat collar. He was approachable in manner,
      had a most genial smile, and was ready with a pleasant response to every
      greeting, its effect being intensified by its musical clarity of
      enunciation. He was distinctly fond of society and especially enjoyed a
      game of cards. Although his wife accompanied him to Washington, she
      appeared little with him in public. She was a good woman with few gifts,
      but a devoted mother, and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_144"
      id="page_144"></a>{144}</span> chief joy in life was to sew for her six
      children. Wherever he went, Mr. Clay was always surrounded by a circle of
      adoring women, who hung upon every word of the many he uttered as he
      talked in desultory style with his back against a sofa-cushion. He
      followed a free fashion of his time in taking toll from the lips of all
      the young and pretty maidens he met. The first time he saw Dolly Madison,
      her youthful face and dainty dress misled him into saluting her in this
      fashion. On discovering his mistake, “Ah, madam,” he pleaded gallantly,
      “had I known you for whom you are, the coin would have been larger!”
    </p>
    <p>
      I may add in passing that the American navy owes its monitor type of
      fighting-craft largely to Henry Clay. Theodore Timby, who invented the
      revolving turret which Ericsson used during the Civil War, came to
      Washington bearing a letter of introduction to Clay, who became interested
      in the idea and helped him get the patent without which it might have been
      lost to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster was cast in quite a different mold from Clay. He was godlike where
      Clay was human; his eloquence overwhelmed his hearers where Clay’s
      fascinated them. He had a big head, a big frame, a big voice, a big
      presence. Emerson speaks of his “awful charm.” Some one who heard him
      condemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_145" id="page_145"></a>{145}</span>
      the dishonest gains of a certain financial institution, says that the word
      “disgorge,” as he uttered it, “seemed to weigh about twelve pounds.” Once
      Mrs. Webster brought their little son to hear his father deliver an
      oration. Daniel began a sentence in his thunder-tone: “Will any man dare
      say&mdash;” and the audience were waiting breathless to hear what was
      coming next, when a wee, piping voice responded from the gallery: “Oh, no,
      no, Papa!”
    </p>
    <p>
      His greatest effort in Congress, of course, was his reply to Hayne.
      Everybody in Washington was eager to hear it, and galleries and floor,
      including the platform on which the Vice-president sat, were crowded to
      the last limit. Representative Lewis of Alabama, being unable to gain
      access to the hall, climbed around behind the wooden framework which
      flanked the platform and bored a hole through it with his pocket-knife in
      order to get a view of the great expounder. At a levee that evening at the
      White House, Webster was besieged by admirers offering congratulations.
      Among the crowd that drew near him at one time happened to be Hayne
      himself. “How are you, Colonel Hayne?” was Webster’s greeting. “None the
      better for you, sir,” answered Hayne, good humoredly but with sincere
      feeling.

      We are treated to another picture of him when he<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_146" id="page_146"></a>{146}</span> arrived late at a concert
      given by Jenny Lind. For the benefit of the statesmen who were present,
      Miss Lind, for an encore, sang “Hail Columbia.” Webster, who had been
      dining, was on his feet in an instant and added his powerful bass voice to
      hers in the chorus. Mrs. Webster did all she could to induce him to sit
      down, but he repeated his effort at the close of every verse, and with the
      last strain made the songstress a profound obeisance, waving his hat at
      the same time. Miss Lind curtsyed in return, Webster repeated his bow, and
      this little comedy of etiquette was kept up for some minutes, to the
      delight of the audience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_147"

      MANY CHANGING YEARS</small>
    </h2>
    <p class="nind">
      <span class="letra">W</span>ITH the advent of the Monroes, social life at
      the President’s House underwent a transformation. Its character could have
      been forecast from the fact that, although for the six years Monroe had
      been at the head of the Cabinet his family had been with him in
      Washington, they were as nearly strangers to the great body of citizens as
      if they had been living in New York or Boston. If a lady wished to call on
      Mrs. Monroe, she had to apply for an appointment and have a day and hour
      fixed, unless she were a member or intimate of some former Presidential
      family. In this administration, too, was born to Washington its first
      formal code of social precedence, which, with certain modifications in
      detail, has remained unchanged to this day. It differs from the codes of
      other American communities in having official rank as a basis. John Quincy
      Adams, before becoming Secretary of State, had served at various times as
      envoy to five European courts. He was therefore ripe with information<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_148" id="page_148"></a>{148}</span> on the
      rules observed abroad and resolved on bringing something of the same sort
      into operation at our capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Monroe and her daughters made it an absolute rule to pay no visits;
      so calls made on them, no matter by whom, went unreturned. Their dislike
      of the underbred caused them to take no part in the preparations for the
      general levees, which were thronged with anybody and everybody; but their
      invitation list for select receptions was cut down mercilessly, and the
      reduced company were treated to supper, an innovation on recent practices.
      At all such entertainments Mrs. Monroe was so exacting in her demands as
      to dress that when one of her near relatives presented himself in an
      informal costume which he had worn without criticism at the best of the
      Jefferson and Madison functions, she refused him admittance till he should
      don the regulation small-clothes and silk hose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Monroes renamed the east room “the banqueting hall” and had their
      state dinners there, partly because of its spaciousness, and partly
      because the dining-room had been so badly damaged in the fire that it took
      a long time to rehabilitate. The table appointments included a central
      oval “plateau” twelve feet long by two feet wide, composed of a mirror<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_149" id="page_149"></a>{149}</span>
      “surrounded by gold females holding candlesticks.” The china was highly
      gilt, and the dessert knives, forks, and spoons were of beaten gold. All
      the plate was the private property of the family and bore the initials “J.
      M.”; much of it was afterward purchased by the Government and made a part
      of the official furnishing of the White House, where it remained in use
      down to Van Buren’s day.
    </p>
    <p>
      A New York Representative went with some friends to dine with the Monroes.
      Arriving at half-past five, his party were “ushered, Indian file, into the
      drawing-room,” where they found “some twenty gentlemen seated in a row in
      solemn state, mute as fishes, having already undergone the ceremony of
      introduction.” And he goes on:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mrs. Monroe was seated at the further end of the room, with other ladies.
      On our approach, she rose and received us handsomely. After being myself
      presented, I introduced the other gentlemen. I now expected to be led to
      the President, but my pilot, the private secretary, had vanished. We beat
      a retreat, each to his respective chair. Observing the President sitting
      very demurely by the chimney-corner, I arose and advanced to him. He got
      up and shook me by the hand, as he did the other gentlemen. This second
      ceremony over, all again was silence, and<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_150" id="page_150"></a>{150}</span> each once more moved to his
      seat. It was a period of great solemnity. Not a whisper broke upon the ear
      to interrupt the silence of the place, and every one looked as if the next
      moment would be his last. After a while the President, in a grave manner,
      began conversation with some one that sat near him, and directly the
      secretary ushered in some more victims, who submitted to the same ordeal
      we had experienced. This continued for fully half an hour, when dinner was
      announced. It became more lively as the dishes rattled.” The party
      remained at table till about half-past eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The retirement of Monroe marked the end of “the Virginia dynasty.” It had
      always been a sore point with John Adams that the highest office of the
      Government should be passed from hand to hand in the Old Dominion, and he
      once threw out the splenetic comment that not “until the last Virginian
      was laid in the graveyard” would his son have a chance at the Presidency.
      The son had been trained with reference to such an inheritance, and, on
      becoming Monroe’s Secretary of State, regarded himself as in the line of
      succession. His appearance as a Presidential candidate, however, aroused
      no general enthusiasm, whereas General Andrew Jackson, having given the
      finishing stroke to the defeat of the British invaders<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_151" id="page_151"></a>{151}</span> by his victory over
      Pakenham, and acquired the nickname “Old Hickory,” had become the idol of
      the multitude. In spite of their approaching competition for the
      Presidency, Adams was obliged to recognize Jackson’s prestige at every
      turn; and on the eighth of January, 1824, Mrs. Adams gave a ball in the
      General’s honor which was so grand that it was still talked of in
      Washington fifty years afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Adams house stood on the site now occupied by the Adams office
      building in F Street near Fourteenth. On this occasion the floor of the
      ballroom was decorated with pictures in colored chalks. The central
      design, which portrayed an American eagle clutching a trophy of flags,
      bore the legend: “Welcome to the Hero of New Orleans!” The pillars were
      trimmed with laurel and other winter foliage, roses were scattered
      everywhere, and the illumination was furnished by variegated lamps, with a
      brilliant luster in the middle of the ceiling. There were eight pieces of
      music. Mrs. Adams was seated in the center of the hall, with Jackson
      standing at her side and a semicircle of distinguished guests behind them.
      President Monroe and Mr. Adams attended, but both were conspicuous for
      their sobriety of attire. It was this gathering which inspired a tribute
      in verse by a local journalist, beginning:<span class="pagenum"><a

    <p>
      Nine months later, Jackson polled a far larger popular vote for the
      Presidency than Adams, and so distributed as to give him a lead in the
      electoral colleges also. But as there were four candidates, none of whom
      had a clear majority of the electoral vote, the decision was left to the
      House of Representatives, where Henry Clay, the candidate at the bottom of
      the list, threw his support to Adams, giving him the office. Adams
      recognized his debt to Clay by appointing him Secretary of State, and thus
      placing him in the line of promotion. Jackson never forgave Clay for his
      share in electing Adams, and from that day forth had nothing to do with
      him beyond the coolest exchange of civilities. In other respects the
      General accepted defeat philosophically, attending the inaugural
      ceremonies and promptly coming forward to congratulate the new President,
      an act of grace that brought tears to the eyes of Adams. The appearance of
      the two men together in public delighted the crowd, and there was
      vociferous hurrahing for Jackson. Judged solely<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_153" id="page_153"></a>{153}</span> by appearances, indeed, the
      day was a festival in honor of Jackson rather than of Adams. Many of the
      General’s friends had come a long distance, in an era when traveling was
      so slow that they had been obliged to leave home before learning the final
      outcome of the election, and supposed that they were to attend the
      inauguration of their favorite. They sought solace for their
      disappointment in turbulent demonstrations. For the whole afternoon the
      dramshops carried on a tremendous business, and all night the streets were
      full of tramping men roaring out Jackson campaign songs and silencing
      opposition with their fists. Pistol shots were heard at frequent
      intervals, and a rumor spread that Henry Clay had been killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever Adams may have thought of these exhibitions, he bore them with a
      calm exterior. He was always indifferent to criticism, and became famous
      as the most shabbily clad man who had ever occupied the Presidential
      chair, being accused even of having worn the same hat for ten years. He
      braved public opinion by setting up a billiard table in the White House,
      which gave a North Carolina Representative a text for a speech denouncing
      the expenditure of fifty dollars for the table and six dollars for a set
      of balls as “alarming to the religious, the moral, and the reflecting
      portion of the community.” The anti-administration<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_154" id="page_154"></a>{154}</span> press, using the game of
      billiards as a theme, opened fire upon the President as a gambler. For a
      fact, he never made but one bet in his life. Clay had picked up at auction
      a picture which Adams tried to buy of him. One day, in jest, Clay offered
      it as a stake for a game of all-fours. To his astonishment, Adams, the
      supposed ascetic, took him up, and won the game and the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a habit of Adams to take a plunge in the Potomac, at the foot of
      his garden, every morning “between daybreak and sunrise,” the weather
      permitting. Once he had all his clothing stolen, and had to catch a
      passing boy and send him home for enough raiment to cover him. But this
      was by no means his most embarrassing adventure. It was during his
      administration that the first woman newspaper correspondent turned up in
      Washington. She was resolved to procure an interview with the President,
      who did not care to gratify her. So she rose early one morning and
      repaired, notebook and pencil in hand, to the river bank, and planted
      herself beside his clothes till he started to come out. Standing almost
      neck-deep in the water, he tried first severity and then persuasion to
      induce her to go away, but she held her ground till he surrendered and
      answered her most important questions.<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_155" id="page_155"></a>{155}</span>

    <p>
      The billiard table was not the only basis for charges of prodigal living
      brought against Adams. When he ran for reëlection, his enemies made
      effective use of a letter written by a member of Congress who had attended
      a New Year’s reception at the White House and who mentioned the
      “gorgeously furnished east room.” The truth was that the east room, except
      for three marble-topped tables and a few mirrors, did not contain fifty
      dollars’ worth of furniture of any sort. A Washingtonian of the period has
      written that there were no chandeliers, and that the great room depended
      for its lighting on candles held in tin candlesticks nailed to the wall,
      which “dripped their sperm upon the clothes of those who came under them,
      as I well know from experience.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Adams sometimes aroused personal hostility by his peppery temper. He had
      to dine with him one evening a Southern Senator who was notorious for his
      dislike of everything in New England but prided himself on his knowledge
      of wines. The Senator had the bad manners to remark that he had “never
      known a Unitarian who did not believe in the sea-serpent.” This aroused
      the ire of Adams, who later, when his guest said that Tokay and Rhine wine
      were somewhat alike, turned upon him with the exclamation: “Sir, I do not
      believe that you ever drank a drop of Tokay in<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_156" id="page_156"></a>{156}</span> your life!” He afterward
      apologized, but the Senator would not accept the apology and became the
      implacable foe of his administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackson’s election in 1828 was a foregone conclusion from the moment he
      reappeared as a Presidential candidate; and, immediately upon the
      announcement that he had won an electoral vote a good deal more than
      double that of Adams, Washington became the Mecca of a hundred
      pilgrimages. By the fourth of March, 1829, the city was so crowded with
      worshipers of the President-elect that they overflowed the inns and
      boarding-houses, and many were obliged to live in camp. Half the men wore
      their trousers tucked into their boot-legs, and not a few carried pistols
      openly in their belts. The hickory emblem was in evidence everywhere: men
      wielded hickory canes and staffs, women wore bonnets trimmed with hickory
      leaves and necklaces composed of hickory nuts fancifully painted, and
      scores of horses were driven with bridles of hickory bark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like his father, Adams did not attend the inauguration of his successor;
      he withdrew to a hired dwelling on the heights north of the city and kept
      to himself till the flurry was over. Probably Jackson did not regret his
      absence, for the campaign had been surcharged with bitter personalities,
      into which the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_157" id="page_157"></a>{157}</span>

      of Mrs. Jackson was remorselessly dragged. Mrs. Jackson had died since
      election day, and the General believed her death the direct result of
      calumny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madison had set the fashion, and Monroe and Adams had improved upon it, of
      having a formal escort to the Capitol on the way to inauguration. Jackson,
      however, refused to follow custom. As the only militia organization in the
      city was under command of a colonel who hated him, he had no military
      display, but walked down the middle of Pennsylvania Avenue with only a
      body-guard composed of veterans of the War of the Revolution, then a
      half-century past. For any lack of enthusiasm on the part of the resident
      population, that of the visiting Jacksonians more than compensated. All
      the way the General and his little party were so surrounded by a yelling,
      cheering crowd that they could advance only at a snail’s pace. To watchers
      on Capitol Hill he was distinguishable from the mob by being the one man
      in the midst of it who walked bareheaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackson was the first President to take the oath of office on the east
      portico of the Capitol, the place now generally used. He also was the
      first to read his speech before being sworn. He wore two pairs of
      spectacles,&mdash;a pair for looking at the crowd and a pair for reading;
      when he was using one pair, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_158"
      id="page_158"></a>{158}</span> other was perched aloft on his forehead. At
      the close of the exercises, he mounted a fine white horse and rode to the
      White House, again having to make his way through a mass of singing and
      shouting admirers. At the mansion a feast had been provided, and the gates
      thrown open to every one. The building was soon stuffed full; and, as the
      people waiting outside could hardly hope to force their way in, negro
      servants came to the doors with buckets of punch and salvers of cakes and
      ices and passed these out. Much of the food and drink was wasted, and much
      china and glassware smashed. Women fainted, men quarreled and bruised one
      another’s faces. At one stage the doorways became so blocked that people
      coming out had to climb through the windows and drop to the ground. The
      rabble inside, bent on shaking the hand of the President, jammed him
      against a wall to the serious peril of his ribs, till he succeeded in
      escaping through a back entry and taking refuge in the hotel where he had
      lately had his lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boisterous incidents of his first day in office were only an earnest
      of the stormy administration which lay before Jackson. Realizing how much
      he was indebted to New York for his election, and that Martin Van Buren
      had a powerful following there, he appointed Van Buren his Secretary of
      State. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_159" id="page_159"></a>{159}</span>
      proved a pretty lucky investment in human nature; for in the Peggy Eaton
      controversy, which broke out soon after Jackson began his term, Van Buren
      was a valuable ally. General John H. Eaton, a lifelong friend whom Jackson
      had appointed Secretary of War, had been boarding for several years with a
      local tavern-keeper named O’Neal. The publican’s daughter, Peggy, had
      grown up a pretty, but pert and forward girl, who flirted with her
      father’s patrons and married one of them, Purser Timberlake of the navy.
      Timberlake was addicted to drink, and during one of his cruises he ended a
      spree by suicide, leaving his wife and children destitute; and Eaton,
      whose name gossip had already linked with the widow’s, came to the front
      with an offer of marriage, which was accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding followed so closely upon the tragedy as to cause wide
      criticism, and this, together with her antecedents, condemned Mrs. Eaton
      to social ostracism. Left to themselves, Eaton’s colleagues of the Cabinet
      would have ignored the circumstances of his marriage, but the ladies of
      their families declared that they would have nothing to do with the bride.
      Van Buren, as a widower with no daughters, felt free to act as he pleased;
      and Jackson, remembering what his own wife had endured, gallantly espoused
      the cause of Mrs. Eaton and gave the hostile Secretaries<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_160" id="page_160"></a>{160}</span> their
      choice between accepting her or resigning their portfolios, whereupon the
      Cabinet went promptly to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being a man of means, Van Buren did a good deal of entertaining for Mrs.
      Eaton’s benefit, and also inspired those members of the diplomatic corps
      who were unaccompanied by ladies to join him in “floating” her. The
      British Minister was a bachelor, so was the Russian Minister; but, though
      the dinners and balls which they gave attracted many feminine guests who
      were flattered by being invited, they were not wholly successful. Madam
      Huygens, wife of the Dutch Minister, for instance, was induced to attend a
      ball, but when escorted to the supper table found that she was expected to
      sit next but one to Mrs. Eaton and would have to exchange a few words with
      that lady. Instantly she placed her arm in that of her husband and
      withdrew with him from the room. When the story was told to Jackson, he
      rose in his wrath and declared that he would send Huygens home to Holland;
      but he never carried out the threat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Viewed in historical perspective, Jackson appears to have been a man of
      tremendous force, thoroughly patriotic, conscientious in even his most
      wayward conceptions of duty, unlearned but not illiterate, and above all
      things hating treachery. He handled the<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_161" id="page_161"></a>{161}</span> sword with more facility
      than the pen, and some of his correspondence, reproduced with its
      crudities of syntax and spelling, would make the better educated angels
      weep. Conscious of his scholastic shortcomings, he rarely attempted
      anything original in writing or speaking, except on public questions; and
      when his autograph was sought in the albums which were the fashionable fad
      of the day, he borrowed his sentiments from the Presbyterian hymn-book,
      quoting, as Miss Martineau recalls, “stanzas of the most ominous import
      from Dr. Watts.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackson usually flavored his dinners and receptions with a dash of the
      unexpected. On one occasion he jostled the proprieties by singing “Auld
      Lang Syne.” He ate sparingly at his own table but talked a great deal,
      slowly and quietly, and, when women were present, with much real
      kindliness of tone. He had a homely way of disposing of questions which he
      regarded as not overimportant. At a dinner in honor of the marriage of his
      adopted son, Andrew Jackson, Junior, he decided on an innovation in
      etiquette by having his Secretary of State precede the diplomatic corps,
      the rest of the Cabinet to follow the foreigners. This plan was vigorously
      resisted by the Secretary of the Treasury, who argued that the Cabinet was
      a unit, and that its members should therefore be treated<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_162" id="page_162"></a>{162}</span> on an
      equal footing. “In that case,” said the President, “we will put all the
      Cabinet ahead of the diplomats,” and he sent his private secretary, Major
      Donelson, to make the announcement to the guests. The French Minister at
      once stirred up the Dutch Minister, as senior member of the corps, to
      prevent the threatened indignity. Meanwhile, dinner had been announced,
      and every one was standing. Donelson reported the strained situation to
      the President, who, instead of vowing “by the Eternal” that his commands
      should be obeyed, smiled good-naturedly and said: “Well, I will lead with
      the bride. It is a family affair; so we’ll waive all difficulties, and the
      company will please to follow as heretofore.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The first baby born in the White House probably was Mary Emily Donelson,
      child of the private secretary. At her baptism in the east room the
      President and Martin Van Buren stood as godfathers. Van Buren took her in
      his arms when she was first brought in, but she squirmed and wriggled so
      that Jackson reached out for her, whereat she cooed with delight, as
      children always did at any attention from him. He held her throughout the
      service, and, at the minister’s question, “Do you, in the name of this
      child, renounce the devil and all his works?” he stiffened up as he might
      have if confronted with a fresh machination<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_163" id="page_163"></a>{163}</span> of his enemies, and
      declared with characteristic emphasis: “I do, sir; I renounce them all!”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during Jackson’s administration that Harriet Martineau first
      visited Washington. She was suffering from overwork and had been orderd by
      her physician in England to cross the sea for a good rest. In spite of
      that, people would not let her alone. It is said that within twenty-four
      hours after her arrival in town more than six hundred persons had called
      to pay their respects. Probably not fifty could have told why they did so,
      except that she was a literary celebrity. One lady was eager to learn
      “whether her novels were really very pretty,” and most of the statesmen,
      when told that she was a political economist, laughed outright. A social
      leader, desirous of giving her a dinner such as she had been accustomed to
      at home, made the table groan under the choicest things the market
      afforded, including eight different meats, only to see the guest confine
      herself to a tiny slice of turkey-breast and a nibble of ham. She was
      equally disconcerting with her other simplicities, such as coming to a
      five o’clock dinner at a little after three, clad in a walking suit in
      which she had been tramping about the city, but bringing in her capacious
      pockets all the trappings necessary for a presentable evening toilet.<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_164" id="page_164"></a>{164}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding her idiosyncrasies, Miss Martineau made a profoundly
      pleasant impression wherever she went. Webster, Clay, and Calhoun would
      desert their seats in the Senate to join her for a talk, and Chief Justice
      Marshall would descend from the bench to greet her when she came into his
      courtroom. She could take up her unpretentious position in the corner of a
      sofa anywhere, and in a few minutes have a circle of the country’s elect
      about her awaiting their turns for a chat; and this in spite of the fact
      that she was very deaf and had to make use of an ear-trumpet of an
      unfamiliar pattern, so that often a newcomer would talk into the wrong
      aperture. She never made anything of her infirmity; and, of all the poems,
      addresses, and letters of appreciation with which she was showered, the
      production which gave her most delight was an ode to her trumpet,
      beginning: “Beloved horn!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in this administration, the east room at the White House, which had
      figured in the Democratic campaign speeches as an audience chamber
      sumptuous enough for royalty, was discovered to be too shabby for a
      President of Jackson’s simple habits. So four large mirrors, heavily
      framed in gilt, were hung against its walls, their bases resting on
      mantels of black Italian marble. Chandeliers gleaming with<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_165" id="page_165"></a>{165}</span> glass
      prisms were suspended from the ceiling; damask-covered chairs, their
      woodwork gilded like the mirror frames, were substituted for the worn-out
      furniture which had sufficed for the Adams family; the windows were richly
      curtained; a Brussels carpet, with the sprawling pattern then so much
      admired, was stretched over the entire floor; and this array of elegance
      was capped with bouquets of artificial flowers, in painted china vases,
      distributed among the mantels and tables and in the window recesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      These things did not long retain their freshness. Jackson’s dinners had
      features quaint enough, but his receptions were little short of riots. A
      literary visitor has left us the description of one where “generals,
      commodores, foreign ministers and members of Congress” brushed elbows with
      laborers who had come in their working clothes from a day of canal
      digging, and “sooty artificers” direct from the forge. “There were majors
      in broadcloth and corduroys, redolent of gin and tobacco, and majors’
      ladies in chintz or russet, with huge Paris earrings, and tawny necks
      profusely decorated with beads of colored glass. There were tailors from
      the board and judges from the bench; lawyers who opened their mouths at
      one bar, and tapsters who closed theirs at another; and one individual&mdash;either
      a miller or a baker&mdash;who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_166"
      id="page_166"></a>{166}</span> wherever he passed, left marks of contact
      on the garments of the company.” Meanwhile, the waiters who attempted to
      cross from the pantry to the east room with cakes and punch were
      intercepted by a ravenous horde who emptied the trays as fast as they
      could be refilled, so that little or nothing reached the better-mannered
      guests. This went on till the Irish butler, in exasperation, enlisted a
      dozen stalwart men and armed them with billets of wood, to surround the
      waiters as a guard, and keep their sticks swinging about the food so
      briskly that it could not be captured except at the cost of a broken head.
      Of course the carpet, curtains, and cushions were deluged with sticky
      refuse, and broken bits of china and glass were ground into powder under
      foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it be possible to imagine anything worse in its way than this scene, it
      was Jackson’s farewell entertainment, given on the twenty-second of
      February, 1837. The chief feature was the cutting of a mammoth cheese
      which had been sent to the President by admirers in a northern dairy
      district. It weighed fourteen hundred pounds, and nothing would satisfy
      Jackson but to give a piece to every man, woman, and child who would come
      for it. As a result, the paths leading to the White House, and the portico
      itself, were thronged that afternoon with people going in to get<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_167" id="page_167"></a>{167}</span> their
      chunks and coming out with greasy parcels in their hands. “We forced our
      way over the threshold,” wrote one of the adventurous souls, “and
      encountered an atmosphere to which the mephitic gas over Avernus must be
      faint and innocuous. On the side of the hall hung a rough likeness of
      General Jackson, emblazoned with eagle and stars, and in the center of the
      vestibule stood the fragrant gift, surrounded by a dense crowd who had in
      two hours cut and purveyed away more than a half-ton of horribly smelling
      ‘Testimonial to the Hero of New Orleans.’ A small segment had been
      reserved for the President’s use, but it is doubtful if he ever tasted
      it.” The cutting was done by two able-bodied laborers, armed with big
      knives extemporized from hand-saws.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the White House, Jackson lived a good deal apart. He was always glad to
      see any one who came on a friendly errand, and loved to frolic with
      children; but one of his chief pleasures was sitting by himself in the big
      south room of the second story and smoking. An aged friend who, as a boy,
      visited the White House with his father while Jackson was there, told me
      that the President bade them draw up with him by the fireside, offered a
      clean clay pipe to the elder of the visitors, and, lighting his own
      well-seasoned corn-cob, puffed the smoke up the chimney, explaining that
      Emily<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_168" id="page_168"></a>{168}</span>
      Donelson&mdash;the wife of his secretary, who kept house for him&mdash;disliked
      the smell of tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ghost of the Peggy Eaton affair could never be permanently exorcised.
      Timberlake had not only died penniless and in debt but left his official
      accounts in confusion, and a year or two later it was discovered that he
      had been a defaulter. His bondsman resisted payment of the shortage,
      accusing Lieutenant Robert B. Randolph, who had taken over Timberlake’s
      papers, of the actual responsibility for it. Randolph, in demanding a
      court-martial, committed a technical breach of discipline for which the
      President dismissed him summarily from the service. One day Jackson was a
      passenger on a river steamboat which stopped briefly at a wharf in
      Alexandria. He was sitting alone, when a stranger approached him as if to
      shake hands. Jackson, seeing him drawing off one of his gloves, said
      amiably, “Never mind your glove, sir,” and stretched out his own hand. But
      the stranger, instead of taking it, made a violent lunge at Jackson’s
      face, exclaiming: “I am Lieutenant Randolph, whom you have wronged and
      insulted, and I came here to pull your nose!” Startled by the noise, two
      or three gentlemen ran forward and sprang upon Randolph, who, in the
      struggle that followed, reached the gangplank and freed himself. The
      President, convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_169" id="page_169"></a>{169}</span>
      by later developments that the Lieutenant had really suffered an
      injustice, offered to reinstate him if he would apologize for the
      nose-pulling; but he scornfully rejected the proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cabinet, as reorganized in consequence of pretty Peggy’s fight, did
      not hang together long. Secretary Eaton intimated presently that he would
      like to retire, Van Buren seemed of the same mind, so the President
      appointed the former Governor of Florida and the latter Minister to
      England. The Senate confirmed Eaton’s appointment with good enough grace,
      but balked at that of Van Buren, who, having gone to England in good faith
      to enter upon his duties, was put to the humiliating necessity of coming
      home again. Jackson was angry, regarding this as a blow at himself. “If
      they don’t want him for Minister,” he thundered, “we’ll see if they like
      him any better as President!” He therefore laid out a program beginning
      with his own reëlection with Van Buren as his Vice-president, and ending
      with Van Buren’s election as his successor. The plan carried; and, as
      Jackson’s affection for Van Buren had grown largely out of the latter’s
      stanch loyalty in the Cabinet quarrel, Mrs. Eaton may be said to have
      shaped American history for a considerable term of years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long after this lady ceased to hold the center of the<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_170" id="page_170"></a>{170}</span> national stage, her career
      continued to be picturesque. Her husband, having retired from the
      Governorship of Florida, was appointed Minister to Spain, and in Madrid
      she appears to have made herself a great favorite at court. After General
      Eaton’s death she returned to Washington, and was living down much of the
      adverse sentiment of former days, when there appeared on the scene an
      Italian dancing-master named Buchignani, whose dark, soulful eyes and
      insinuating manners proved too much for even her experienced heart.
      Although she was well advanced in years and he was young enough to be her
      son, she not only became his wife, but let all her comfortable fortune
      slip into his hands, and gradually gave him also the custody of her
      grandchildren’s property, which she was holding in trust. He repaid her
      kindness by eloping with her favorite granddaughter to Canada, where he
      went into business as a saloon-keeper. Mrs. Buchignani died in 1879, still
      glorying in the memory of her early activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Vice-president, Van Buren lived in the Decatur house, the big somber
      brick dwelling on the corner of Jackson Place and H Street. Across the
      park, just south of the present home of the Cosmos Club, lived Mr. and
      Mrs. Ogle Tayloe, with whom it was his habit to pass his disengaged
      evenings. Suddenly he ceased<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_171"

      coming, and after some weeks Mr. Tayloe hunted him up to inquire what was
      the matter. His only response was: “Mrs. Tayloe has things lying about on
      her table which should not be there.” Van Buren had always seemed
      interested in Mrs. Tayloe’s collection of contemporary autographs; and,
      when husband and wife were searching there for the possible cause of
      offense, they came upon a letter from a prominent New York politician
      containing the passage: “What is little Matt doing? Some dirty work, of
      course, as usual.” Mrs. Tayloe cut out the derogatory paragraph and sent
      word to Van Buren that she had done so, and at once he renewed his visits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackson escorted Van Buren to the Capitol, for his inauguration, in a
      carriage widely celebrated as the “Constitution coach.” It was a present
      to the General from citizens of New York and was built out of timbers from
      the old war frigate <i>Constitution</i>, a picture of which was emblazoned
      on one panel. Van Buren discovered, before he had been long in office,
      that a thousand things which the people accepted without question from a
      military hero they were prepared to criticize in a civilian. Moreover, his
      son John, while in England some years before, had danced with the Princess
      Victoria and thus acquired the nickname “Prince John,” of which the
      enemies of the administration<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_172"
      id="page_172"></a>{172}</span> made use as a political cudgel, declaring
      that the whole family were aping the foreign aristocracy. Along came the
      financial panic of 1837, reducing thousands of well-to-do persons to
      poverty, and this was fatuously laid to Van Buren’s account when he stood
      for reëlection in 1840 against General William Henry Harrison,
      affectionately styled “Old Tippecanoe” in memory of one of his victories.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of the fact that Jackson had refurnished the White House
      expensively for those days and then given entertainments which spoiled
      nearly everything spoilable, it was Van Buren who became the undeserving
      target for attack on the ground that he maintained “a royal establishment”
      in “a palace as splendid as that of the Cæsars, and as richly adorned as
      the proudest Asiatic mansion.” The stump orators harped on the use of gold
      and silver spoons at the White House table, and on the excessive number of
      spittoons distributed in the parlors and halls. Vainly did the President’s
      defenders show that the gold spoons were mostly plated ware, and that the
      spittoons, like the other furniture, were the property of the Government:
      the voters who ate their porridge from wooden vessels and threw their
      quids into boxes of sawdust were resolved upon putting into his place a
      man of different type. Henry Clay, passing the White House one day when<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_173" id="page_173"></a>{173}</span> a blaze
      broke out in the laundry, joined the firemen in helping to extinguish it,
      remarking jocularly to the President: “Though we are bound to have you out
      of here, Mr. Van Buren, we don’t want you burned out.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Harrison was elected. He was sixty-eight when he arrived in Washington in
      February, 1841, and was in delicate health, but affected a vain pretense
      of robustness. Though the day was chilly, with snow thinly covering the
      streets and a cold rain falling, he declined to enter a carriage, and
      walked half a mile to the City Hall with his hat in his hand, bowing to
      the people on either side of the street. At the hall he stood on the
      portico, still uncovered, while the Mayor made a speech of welcome and he
      responded. His exposure gave him a cold which, following his fatigues and
      excitement, brought on a serious nervous attack, and this was not improved
      by the prospect of a wearisome inaugural ceremony. He had only a common
      school education, but had read a good deal, particularly ancient history.
      Mr. Webster, whom he had selected for Secretary of State, recognizing his
      literary limitations, composed an excellent inaugural address and carried
      it to him, saying in explanation: “I feared lest, with all you are called
      upon to do just now, you might not find time to do anything of this sort.”<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_174" id="page_174"></a>{174}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes,” answered Harrison, cheerfully, producing a packet of neatly
      written sheets, “I attended to all that before leaving home.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster tactfully contrived to induce him to exchange manuscripts, “so
      that each author could read the other’s production, and whichever proved
      the better could be used.”
    </p>
    <p>
      But the next day Harrison handed back Webster’s paper with the remark: “If
      I were to read your address, everybody would know you wrote it. Mine is
      not so good, but at least it is mine, and I shall prefer my own poor work
      to your brilliant one.” As a last resort Webster offered to revise
      Harrison’s address, and Harrison consented, though very reluctantly.
      Webster struggled with his task a whole day, chopping out paragraph after
      paragraph of classical citations. When a lady that evening inquired what
      he had been doing to make him look so ill, he exclaimed: “You’d be ill,
      too, if you had committed all the crimes I have. Within twelve hours I
      have killed seventeen Roman pro-consuls&mdash;dead as smelts, every man of
      them!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Though compelled to sacrifice so much of his antique lore, Harrison was
      not to be argued out of his resolve to ride a white horse to and from his
      inauguration, having read of sundry great Romans who thus traversed the
      Appian Way. He refused, too, to wear an<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_175" id="page_175"></a>{175}</span> overcoat on the fourth of
      March, notwithstanding that he had a heavy cold, and that a stiff gale was
      blowing which searched the vitals of most men in thick garments. Nor would
      he consent to cover his head while delivering his address, which was a
      protest against executive usurpation, the corruption of the press, and the
      abuses of party spirit. Few who heard it realized how near they had come
      to witnessing no inaugural ceremony that day. It had been arranged that
      Harrison should join the procession for the Capitol at the house of a
      friend whom he was visiting, but he was in such a state of nervous
      exhaustion that he fainted twice before the time came to start. His
      companions bathed his temples with brandy, and the physician they called
      in forbade his going out of doors unless in a carriage; but he would hear
      to no change of plans, and managed, by sheer force of will, not only to
      perform his part at the Capitol, but to hold an afternoon reception at the
      White House and in the evening to look in at two or three balls with which
      the Whigs were celebrating their triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the fortnight that followed, he did his best to conceal his
      increasing feebleness, even going in person to market every morning when
      he was able. But a succession of colds presently ran into pneumonia, and
      the office-seekers hounded him not the less cruelly<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_176" id="page_176"></a>{176}</span> after this. Just one month
      from the day of his inauguration, death came to his relief. Mrs. Harrison,
      who had been too ill to accompany him to Washington, never saw him from
      the day he parted with her in Ohio till his body was brought back to her
      for burial.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_177" id="page_177"></a>{177}</span>

      SPIRIT OF GREAT EVENTS”</small>
    </h2>
    <p class="nind">
      <span class="letra">J</span>OHN TYLER, the first Vice-president to receive
      promotion to the Presidency in mid-term, was at his home in Virginia when
      Harrison died. He came to Washington at once and took lodgings at a hotel,
      where, two days later, he was sworn in by Chief Judge Cranch of the
      Circuit Court of the District. His administration was not picturesque in
      the usual sense; the most it gave people to talk about was his narrow
      escape from impeachment for deserting the party which elected him. But his
      unpopularity bore valuable fruit for Washington. When the partisan
      excitement was at its highest pitch, a company of local politicians went
      to the White House one night and, drawn up in front of it, “groaned” their
      disapproval of Tyler’s conduct. To protect the Presidential office from
      further indignities of that sort, a bill was introduced in the Senate to
      establish an “auxiliary guard” for the defense of the public and private
      property against incendiaries, and “for the enforcement<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_178" id="page_178"></a>{178}</span> of the
      police regulations of the city of Washington,” with an appropriation of
      seven thousand dollars to equip a captain and fifteen men with the proper
      implements to distinguish them in the discharge of their duty. This was
      the foundation of the Metropolitan Police force, which now numbers
      seventy-five officers and more than six hundred privates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life at the White House was simple in Tyler’s time. The President was in
      the habit of rising with the sun, lighting a fire that had been laid
      overnight in his study, and working at his desk till breakfast was served
      at eight o’clock. At this meal he insisted on having the ladies of his
      family appear in calico frocks. In the evening all the household would
      gather in the green parlor and pass an hour or two in entertaining any
      visitors who happened in, interspersing conversation with piano music and
      old-fashioned songs. It was Tyler who introduced the custom of periodical
      open-air concerts by the Marine Band; and on warm Saturday afternoons the
      garden south of the White House was a favorite resort of the best people
      of the city, while the President would sit with his family and a few
      invited guests on the porch, listening to the music and responding to the
      salutations of his acquaintances. Tyler is rarely suspected of possessing
      a strong sense of humor; but he must have smiled when he signed<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_179" id="page_179"></a>{179}</span> an
      official letter to the Emperor of China, in which he described himself as
      “President of the United States of America, which States are Maine, New

      who presented the missive got everything he asked for.

      Tyler lost his wife soon after he entered the White House, and his
      daughters presided over the domestic life there. He was fond of young
      society, and one of the belles who appeared pretty regularly at his
      parties was Miss Virginia Timberlake, daughter of the unfortunate naval
      purser and the lady whose cause Jackson and Van Buren had championed.
      Another was Miss Julia Gardiner of New York, who so captivated him that at
      one of his receptions in the second year of his term he made her a
      proposal of marriage. As she described it afterward, she was taken wholly
      by surprise, and gave her “No, no, no!” such emphasis by shaking her head
      that she whisked the tassel of her crimson Greek cap into his face with
      every motion. The controlling reason for her refusal, she explained,<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_180" id="page_180"></a>{180}</span> was her
      unwillingness to leave her father, to whom she was devotedly attached; but
      an accident soon changed the whole face of things.

    <p>
      Captain Stockton of the navy invited a party of about four hundred ladies
      and gentlemen to inspect the sloop-of-war <i>Princeton</i>, then lying in
      the Potomac. President Tyler, the members of his Cabinet and their
      families, and a good many Congressmen were among the guests. The vessel
      had dropped down the river to a point near Mount Vernon, when some of the
      party importuned Stockton to fire his big gun, nicknamed “the peacemaker.”
      This was just at the close of the luncheon, and the ladies had lingered at
      table while most of the gentlemen went on deck. One lady, fortunately, had
      detained Tyler as he was about to leave, by inducing him to listen to a
      song; for the gun exploded, killing Mr. Upshur, Secretary of State, Mr.
      Gilmer, Secretary of the Navy, Commander Kennon of the navy, Virgil Maxey,
      lately American Minister at the Hague, and David Gardiner of New York, the
      father of Miss Julia. A day of merrymaking was thus turned into one of
      mourning, as the vessel slowly moved up the stream again, bearing the
      bodies of the dead, for whom funeral services were held at the White
      House. After an interval the President renewed his suit and found Miss
      Gardiner more pliant. When he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_181"

      had composed in her honor a serenade beginning, “Sweet lady, awake!” she
      agreed to marry him if her mother would consent. Her mother did not
      approve of a union between a man of fifty-six and a girl of twenty, but,
      as she did not actually forbid it, they had a very quiet wedding.

      In spite of the enjoyment he took in social intercourse, Tyler was often
      criticized for his frigid manners. A virulent type of influenza which
      became epidemic during his administration received the name of “the Tyler
      grip,” from the remark of a Boston man who fell ill a few hours after
      being presented to him: “I probably caught cold from shaking hands with
      the President.” A good deal was made of this in the campaign of 1844, and
      added point to John Quincy Adams’s denunciation of Tyler for “performing
      with a young girl from New York the old fable of January and May!” Tyler’s
      general unpopularity, and a deadlock between two other prominent
      candidates, led the Democrats to nominate James K. Polk for President. He
      was so little known to most of the voters that throughout the campaign the
      Whigs, who were supporting Henry Clay, rang the changes on the question,
      “Who <i>is</i> James K. Polk?” thus contrasting his obscurity with Clay’s
      eminence. The count of ballots showed that a candidate of whom little was
      known<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_182" id="page_182"></a>{182}</span>
      might have certain advantages over one long before the public eye; and as
      on inauguration day it rained heavily, exultant Democrats kept themselves
      warm by hurling back at the Whigs the familiar cry, “Who <i>is</i> James
      K. Polk?” and then laughing wildly at their own humor. It was on this
      occasion that the telegraph first conveyed out of Washington the news that
      one President had retired and another had come in&mdash;Professor Morse
      having set up an instrument at the edge of the platform on which the
      President-elect stood, and ticked off a report of the proceedings as they
      occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Polk being a devoted church-member, of a school which disapproved of
      dancing, the inaugural ball that evening shrank into a mere promenade
      concert till after she and her husband had quitted the hall. The social
      activities of the Polks, through the four years which followed, were
      consistent with this beginning, all the functions at the White House being
      too sober to suit the diplomats or the younger element among the resident
      population. On its practical side, Polk’s term was perhaps the most
      notable in that generation, including as it did the war with Mexico, which
      resulted in the annexation of California and the great southwestern area
      afterward carved into the States of Utah, Nevada, and Arizona and parts of
      Wyoming,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_183" id="page_183"></a>{183}</span>
      Colorado, and New Mexico. This war, moreover, furnished the usual crop of
      Presidential candidates, chief among them General Zachary Taylor, who had
      led the first army across the Rio Grande, and General Winfield Scott, who
      had wound up the invasion by capturing the city of Mexico.
    </p>
    <p>
      Believing Taylor the easier to handle, the Whig managers fixed upon him,
      although, having passed the larger part of his sixty-four years with the
      army, he had never voted. Indeed, he had always expressed an aversion to
      office-holding, and, when approached on the subject of the Presidency, met
      the overture with frank disfavor, declaring that he had neither the
      capacity nor the experience needed for such a position. But his
      “availability” overcame the force of his protests, and the Whigs won with
      him a sweeping victory at the polls. There is pathos in the story of the
      break-up of the pleasant home in Baton Rouge, and the reluctant removal of
      the family to Washington, taking with them only a faithful negro servant,
      a favorite dog, and “Old Whitey,” the horse the General had ridden through
      the Mexican war. Taylor was with difficulty dissuaded from his purpose of
      imitating his military predecessors and riding “Old Whitey” either to or
      from the Capitol on inauguration day. What his friends most feared was his
      loss of dignity in the eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_184"
      id="page_184"></a>{184}</span> of the crowd, for his legs were so short
      that, in certain emergencies, an orderly had to lift one of them over his
      horse’s flanks whenever he mounted or dismounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taylor was as simple a soul as Harrison. His unostentatious ways in the
      army had led the soldiers to dub him “Old Rough and Ready,” and this title
      stuck to him always afterward. One of his favorite amusements was to walk
      about Washington, chatting informally with people he met and watching
      whatever was going on in the streets. His love of comfort was such that he
      could never be induced to wear clothes that fitted him, but his suits were
      always a size or two larger than his measure, and these, with a black silk
      hat set far back on his head, made him recognizable at any distance. His
      message at the opening of Congress contained one announcement as
      voluminous as his costume: “We are at peace with all the nations of the
      world, and the rest of mankind.” The bull was discovered too late to
      prevent its going out in the original print; but in a revised edition the
      sentence was made to end: “And seek to maintain our cherished relations of
      amity with them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The White House underwent another grand refurbishing while the Taylors
      were in it. The east room was newly carpeted, its walls were decorated,
      and gas replaced its candles and lamps. The ladies of the<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_185" id="page_185"></a>{185}</span> family
      were good housekeepers&mdash;particularly the younger daughter, who made
      the old place look actually homelike, and whom an appreciative guest
      described as doing the honors “with the artlessness of a rustic belle and
      the grace of a duchess.” But this pleasant picture was soon to be clouded
      over. On the fourth of July, 1850, a patriotic meeting was held at the
      base of the Washington National Monument, with long addresses by prominent
      men. It lasted the whole of a very hot afternoon, and President Taylor, as
      a guest of honor, felt bound to stay through it, refreshing himself from
      time to time with copious drafts of ice-water. He reached home in a state
      of some exhaustion and at once ate a basketful of cherries and drank
      several glasses of iced milk. From a party to which he had accepted an
      invitation for that evening he was obliged to excuse himself at the last
      moment on the score of indisposition. He was violently ill throughout the
      night, and five days later he died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Millard Fillmore of New York, fifty years old, of moderate political views
      and fair ability, was Vice-president at the time. Unlike Tyler, he went to
      the Capitol to be sworn in the presence of a committee of the two houses,
      but made no inaugural address. Mrs. Fillmore, who had formerly been a
      teacher, cared little for society. She was of studious habits and soon<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_186" id="page_186"></a>{186}</span>
      converted the oval sitting room in the second story of the White House
      into a library, personally selecting the books. Her taste ran chiefly to
      standard historical and classical works; and, as the editions then
      available were generally not very good specimens of the typographic art,
      most of her collection has disappeared. In this administration the
      Fugitive Slave Act was passed, and Fillmore, by signing it, alienated the
      North so largely that the Whig party refused to nominate him for another
      term. General Scott, to whom it turned, did precisely what most of the
      politicians had predicted he would: made a number of public utterances
      which ruined his chances and thus gave the election to his Democratic
      competitor, Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      During Fillmore’s term Louis Kossuth visited Washington. The country was
      just passing through one of its occasional periods of revolutionary
      fervor, and Kossuth’s stand for the rights of Hungary against Austria had
      aroused much sympathy here. Our public men were divided in opinion as to
      how far to go with their demonstrations in his favor, wishing to win the
      support of the Hungarians in the United States and of immigrants who had
      fled from other countries to escape oppression, yet hoping to keep clear
      of entanglements with Austria. As Kossuth had left home to<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_187" id="page_187"></a>{187}</span> escape
      death for high treason and taken refuge in Constantinople, one of our
      men-of-war was sent to the Dardanelles to bring him to America. He did not
      then care to go further than England, whence, after an agreeable visit, he
      came over, in the expectation of inducing our Government to take up arms
      for Hungarian liberty. Henry Clay, who was already stricken with his last
      illness, promptly put a damper upon that scheme; but Kossuth remained the
      guest of the nation for a time and was dined and fêted prodigiously. He
      maintained the state of a royal personage, keeping a uniformed and armed
      guard about the door of his suite of apartments at what is now the
      Metropolitan Hotel, and a lot of carousing young subalterns always in his
      anteroom. He never appeared in public except in full military uniform,
      with his cavalry sword, in its steel scabbard, clanking by his side. Mrs.
      Kossuth, who accompanied him on his tour, was unable to overcome her
      distrust of American cooking, and used to scandalize her neighbors at
      table by ostentatiously smelling of every new dish before tasting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inauguration of Pierce was marked by several innovations: he drove to
      and from the Capitol standing up in his carriage, delivered his address
      without notes, and made affirmation instead of taking the oath of office.
      A tragic interest attaches itself to his<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_188" id="page_188"></a>{188}</span> administration, because,
      just as he was preparing to remove to Washington, he lost his only child,
      a boy of thirteen, in a railway accident. Mrs. Pierce, who was an invalid,
      was terribly broken by this bereavement, and all social festivities at the
      White House were abandoned till toward the close of her stay there. The
      new Vice-president, William R. King, was not inaugurated at the same time
      and place with the President. He had gone to Cuba in January for his
      health, and, as he was not well enough to come home, Congress passed a
      special act permitting him to take the oath before the American
      Consul-general at Havana. Soon after his return to the United States, in
      April, he died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nathaniel Hawthorne, who was a college mate and intimate friend of Pierce,
      was anxious to see something of Europe, but had not the means to gratify
      his desire; so Pierce appointed him consul at Liverpool, where he was able
      to live in comfort on his pay and save enough for a sojourn on the
      Continent. To this experience American literature owes most of his later
      work, including “The Marble Faun” and “Our Old Home.” In Washington still
      linger stories of a visit Hawthorne paid the city about the time of his
      appointment. Pierce tried to show him some informal attentions; but
      Hawthorne’s shyness, which went to such an extreme that he could not say
      anything to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_189" id="page_189"></a>{189}</span>
      lady next him at table without trembling and blushing, prevented his
      making much headway socially.
    </p>
    <p>
      All through Pierce’s term, political conditions were working up to the
      point which caused the irruption of a few years later. The habit of
      carrying deadly weapons on the person became so common in Washington,
      especially in Congress, that scarcely an altercation occurred between two
      men without the exposure, if not the use, of a pistol or a dirk. The
      newspapers in their serious columns treated such incidents severely, while
      the comic paragraphers satirized them; and Preston Brooks, a
      Representative from South Carolina, in a half-earnest, half-cynical vein,
      gave notice one day of his intention to offer this amendment to the rules
      of the House: “Any member who shall bring into the House a concealed
      weapon, shall be expelled by a vote of two-thirds. The Sergeant-at-Arms
      shall cause a suitable rack to be erected in the rotunda, where members
      who are addicted to carrying concealed weapons shall be required to place
      them for the inspection of the curious, so long as the owners are employed
      in legislation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Senator Sumner of Massachusetts having, a few days later, in a speech on
      slavery, spoken disparagingly of a South Carolina Senator who was absent,
      Brooks, on the twenty-second of May, 1856, entered the Senate<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_190" id="page_190"></a>{190}</span> chamber
      when it was nearly deserted, and, with a heavy gutta-percha cane, rained
      blows with all his strength upon the head of Sumner, who was quietly
      writing at his desk. Sumner fell to the floor and for some days thereafter
      hovered between life and death. He was three or four years in recovering
      from the direct effects of the assault, and never was entirely restored to
      health and strength. The incident excited bitter feeling throughout both
      North and South. For denouncing the assault as paralleling that of Cain
      upon Abel, Representative Anson Burlingame of New York was challenged by
      Brooks; he accepted the challenge, naming date, place, and weapons, but
      Brooks failed to appear on the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next President was James Buchanan of Pennsylvania, also a Democrat.
      The two incidents in his term which most impressed Washington were the
      first successful experiments with the Atlantic cable in August, 1858, and
      the visit to the White House of the Prince of Wales, who later became King
      Edward VII. Cyrus W. Field, after a struggle as soul-wearing as Morse’s
      over the introduction of the telegraph, succeeded in making his submarine
      cable work and induced Queen Victoria to send the first despatch, a
      message of greeting to President Buchanan, who was requested to answer it
      in kind. The skepticism of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_191"
      id="page_191"></a>{191}</span> day toward all scientific novelties was
      reflected in Buchanan’s summoning a newspaper correspondent whom he
      trusted and begging to be told frankly whether he were not the victim of a
      hoax. At the White House all the members of the Cabinet were gathered,
      earnestly debating the same question. The most stubborn disbeliever was
      the Secretary of the Treasury, Howell Cobb, who jeered at the whole thing
      as a wild absurdity. In spite of Cobb’s resistance, the correspondent
      persuaded the President to answer the Queen’s message. As bad luck would
      have it, the cable parted in mid-ocean soon thereafter and was not
      restored to working order for several years; and in the interval the
      skeptics were appropriately exultant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buchanan, who was our first bachelor President, was sometimes slangily
      called “the O. P. F.,” having once referred to himself in a message as an
      “old public functionary.” The image of him carried in the popular mind is
      derived from contemporaneous pictures, which show him as a stiff, precise,
      ministerial-looking old man, wearing a black coat, a high choker collar,
      and a spotless white neckerchief. But this was the style of the day in
      portraiture and must not be accepted too literally. The late Frederick O.
      Prince of Boston used to tell of a morning call he paid<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_192" id="page_192"></a>{192}</span>
      Buchanan, whom he had imagined a model of formality and elegance, and of
      his astonishment when the President entered the room clad in a greenish
      figured dressing-gown, woolen socks, and carpet slippers, and, to put the
      standing visitors at their ease, called to a servant: “Jeems, sit some
      cheers!”
    </p>
    <p>
      When Buchanan came to Washington for his inauguration, attended by a
      number of Pennsylvania friends, he took lodgings at the National Hotel,
      where the whole party fell ill with symptoms which to-day we should charge
      to ptomaine poisoning. One or two of the sufferers died. Buchanan escaped
      with a comparatively light attack; but a rumor gained circulation that the
      Free Soilers had tried to assassinate him because of his conservative
      disposition toward slavery. For some time after he entered the White
      House, therefore, the police kept a watch on his movements, and one
      rough-looking Kansan was arrested on suspicion, having bought an air-gun
      and engaged a room in a building which the President was in the habit of
      passing every day when he went out for exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The domestic accommodations at the White House were already so limited
      that, when the Prince of Wales visited it in 1860, the President had to
      give up his bedchamber to his guest and sleep on a cot in the anteroom of
      his office. As I recall the Prince he was not<span class="pagenum"><a

      inordinately tall, but for some reason&mdash;possibly because the legs of
      royalty were supposed to need more space than those of common folk&mdash;the
      old bedstead in the President’s room was replaced by one of extra length.
      Society in Washington was agog over the Prince’s advent, and the reigning
      belles insisted that his entertainment must include a ball at least as
      brilliant as that given in his honor in New York; but Mr. Buchanan, whose
      ideas on certain subjects were rigid, would not listen to the suggestion
      of dancing in the White House, and the ball was turned over to the British
      legation. Miss Harriet Lane, the President’s niece, who managed his
      household affairs, gave instead a large musicale, at which was performed
      for the first time the once favorite song, “The Mocking Bird,” its
      composer having dedicated it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trained as attorney, diplomatist, and politician, to regard the letter of
      the law rather than its spirit, Buchanan found himself in an unhappy
      situation when the preliminary mutterings of sectional warfare grew loud.
      In January, 1861, he was urged by some of the Cabinet to recall Major
      Robert Anderson from Charleston Harbor as a rebuke for having removed the
      Fort Moultrie garrison to the stronger Fort Sumter without orders from
      Washington, and he was holding the matter under advisement when Justice
      McLean of the Supreme Court<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_194"
      id="page_194"></a>{194}</span> came to dine with him one evening. After
      the ladies had left the table, the Justice drew the President aside and
      inquired what was going to be done about the Major. “Anderson has exceeded
      his instructions,” answered Buchanan, “and must be disciplined.” McLean
      raised his hand and fairly shook it in the President’s face as he
      ejaculated: “You dare not do it, sir! You dare not do it!” This unique
      defiance of the executive by the judiciary had an immediate effect: Major
      Anderson was left undisturbed, to become within a few weeks the first hero
      of the Civil War.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Scott, who filled a large place in national affairs from Polk’s
      administration till the autumn of 1861, was a good officer and a pure
      patriot but full of eccentricities. His love for military forms gave him
      the nickname “Old Fuss and Feathers,” and a letter he wrote during the
      Mexican war, excusing his absence from his headquarters when the Secretary
      of War called there, on the plea that he had just stepped out to get “a
      hasty plate of soup,” had won for him the punning title “Marshal Turenne.”
      He was a good deal of a gourmet and did his family marketing himself,
      especially delighting in the delicacy which he persisted in calling
      “tarrapin,” and ordering his oysters by the barrel. One of his favorite
      dishes was pork jowl, and once he told of having eaten sauerkraut “with
      tears<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_195" id="page_195"></a>{195}</span>
      in his eyes.” He was a keen stickler for the dignity due him on all
      occasions. Just after Taylor had been inaugurated President, the two men
      met in Washington for the first time since a somewhat acrimonious parting
      in Mexico. Taylor, passing over old animosities, invited Scott to call.
      Scott did so the next day, and Taylor, who was engaged with some other
      gentlemen in his office, sent word that he would be down in a moment. Five
      minutes later, having cut his business short, the President descended to
      the parlor, to find his visitor already gone: Scott had waited two minutes
      by the clock and then stalked in high dudgeon out of the door, not to come
      back again.

      The drama of the Lincoln administration, on which the curtain rose to a
      bugle-blast and fell to the beat of muffled drums, deserves a volume to
      itself; but in my limited space I have been able to outline only some of
      its features directly related to the capital city. Lincoln’s first levee
      was held not in the White House but at Willard’s Hotel, some days before
      the inauguration. The higher public functionaries and their wives, and a
      number of private citizens of prominence, had been notified rather than
      invited to come to the hotel on a certain evening for a first glimpse of
      the new chief magistrate. Into this presence stalked the lank,<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_196" id="page_196"></a>{196}</span>
      loose-jointed, oddly clad “Old Abe,” with his little, simple,
      white-shawled wife at his elbow, and the never failing jest on his lips as
      he made his own announcement: “Ladies and gentlemen, let me present to you
      the long and the short of the Presidency!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lincolns received several social courtesies from members of Congress
      and others before the fourth of March, and on the evening of that day the
      usual inaugural ball was given in their honor. It was plain from the start
      that they had not made a favorable impression in their new setting, for
      the ball was a failure in point of attendance; few ladies wore fine
      costumes, and of the men the majority came in their business clothes. As
      neither Mr. nor Mrs. Lincoln knew how to dance, or felt enough confidence
      even to walk through a quadrille, the early part of the evening was
      devoted to a handshaking performance which threw a chill upon the rest.
      Mrs. Lincoln’s feminine instinct had led her to exchange the stuffy frock
      and shawl of her first reception for a blue silk gown. Mr. Buchanan had
      been expected but sent belated regrets; and Stephen A. Douglas, the
      “Little Giant” who always became a big one in an emergency, stepped into
      the breach as representative of the abdicating party, and established
      himself as the personal escort and knight-in-waiting of Mrs. Lincoln.<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_197" id="page_197"></a>{197}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the White House, Lincoln took for his office the large square room in
      the second story next the southeast corner, from the windows of which he
      could look over at the Virginia hills. The room adjoining on the west was
      assigned to his clerks and to visitors waiting for an interview. To secure
      him a little privacy in passing between his office and the oval library, a
      wooden screen was run across the south end of the waiting room, and behind
      this he used to make the transit in fancied invisibility, to the delight
      of the people sitting on the other side, to whom, owing to his
      extraordinary height, the top locks of his hair and a bit of his forehead
      were exposed above the partition. He was persistently hounded by
      candidates for appointment to office; and it is recalled that in one
      instance, where two competitors for a single place had worn him out with
      their importunities, he sent for a pair of scales, weighing all the
      petitions in favor of one candidate and then those of the other, and
      giving the appointment to the man whose budget weighed three-quarters of a
      pound more than his rival’s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visitors admitted to his office usually found him very kind in manner,
      though now and then a satirical impulse would give an edge to his humor.
      When an irate citizen with a grievance called and poured it out upon him,
      accompanied by a variegated assortment<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_198" id="page_198"></a>{198}</span> of profanity, Lincoln
      waited patiently till the speaker halted to take breath, and then
      inquired: “You’re an Episcopalian, aren’t you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why do you ask that?” demanded the visitor, momentarily forgetting his
      anger in his surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because,” answered Lincoln, “Seward’s an Episcopalian, and you swear just
      like him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend Doctor Bellows of New York, as chairman of the Sanitary
      Commission, called once during the Civil War to tell Lincoln of a number
      of things he ought to do. Lincoln listened with the most flattering
      attention, slightly inclining his head in recognition of every separate
      reminder of a duty left unperformed, and at the close of the catalogue
      remained a minute or two in silent meditation. Then, throwing one of his
      long legs over an arm of his chair, he looked up with a quizzical smile.
      “Dominie,” said he, “how much will you take to swap jobs with me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not always keep his humor out of his official communications, as
      in this despatch to General Hooker in Virginia: “If the head of Lee’s army
      is at Martinsburg, and the tail of it on the plank road between
      Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, the animal must be pretty slim
      somewhere. Couldn’t you break him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, it was his instinctive discernment of the<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_199" id="page_199"></a>{199}</span> ridiculous side of
      everything which, though it gave his enemies their chance to assail him as
      a mountebank and a jester, undoubtedly served as a buffer to many a heavy
      blow. Sometimes his laughs were at his own expense. About the middle of
      the war a young man from a distant State procured an interview with him,
      to expound a project for visiting Richmond in the disguise of a wandering
      organ-grinder and making drawings of the defenses of the city for the use
      of the Union commanders. Lincoln was so impressed that he contributed one
      hundred and fifty dollars or more to purchase the organ and pay other
      preliminary expenses. The young man disappeared for some weeks and then
      returned with a thrilling account of his adventures, and with plats and
      charts covering everything of military importance around Richmond and at
      various points on the way thither. As a reward, the President nominated
      him for a second lieutenancy in the army and spurred some other patriot
      into sending him a brand new uniform and sword. After a little, and by
      accident, it came out that the youth had never been anywhere near
      Richmond, but had spent the President’s money on a trip to his home,
      where, at his ease, he had prepared his fictitious report and maps. Of
      course his nomination was at once withdrawn; but Lincoln was so amused at
      his own childlike credulity<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_200"
      id="page_200"></a>{200}</span> that he could not bring himself to punish
      the offense as it deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cabinet were often annoyed at the obtrusion of the President’s taste
      for a joke at what seemed to them inopportune moments&mdash;especially
      Secretary Stanton, whose sense of humor was not keen. On September 22,
      1862, they were peremptorily summoned to a meeting at the White House.
      They found the President reading a book, from which he barely looked up
      till all were in their seats. Then he said: “Gentlemen, did you ever read
      anything from Artemus Ward? Let me read you a chapter which is very
      funny.” When the reading was finished, he laughed heartily, looking around
      the circle for a response, but nobody even smiled; if any countenance
      revealed anything, it was irritation. “Well,” said he, “let’s have another
      chapter;” and he suited action to word. Finding his listeners no more
      sympathetic than before, he threw the book down with a deep sigh and
      exclaimed: “Gentlemen, why don’t you laugh? With the fearful strain that
      is on me night and day, if I did not laugh I should die, and you need this
      medicine as much as I do.” With that, he ran his hand down into his tall
      hat, which sat on the table near him, and drew forth a sheet of paper,
      from which he read aloud, with the most impressive emphasis, the first
      draft of the Emancipation<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_201"
      id="page_201"></a>{201}</span> Proclamation. “If any of you have any
      suggestions to make as to the form of this paper or its composition,” said
      he, “I shall be glad to hear them. But”&mdash;and the deliberateness with
      which he pronounced the next words left no doubt that the die had already
      been cast&mdash;“this paper is to issue!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lincolns brought two young children with them into the White House,
      both boys. Of the elder, Willie, we hear little, except that he died
      there, and that his loss added one more to the many lines which the war
      had worn into the brow of his father. The younger boy, “Tad,” is better
      known to the public through the exploitation of his juvenile pranks by the
      newspapers and his appearance in some of the President’s portraits. Many
      stories are told of his fondness for bringing ragged urchins from the
      streets into the kitchen and feeding them, to the sore distress of the
      cook and sometimes to the disturbance of the domestic routine in other
      ways; but for whatever he wished to do in the charitable line he found his
      father a faithful ally. There is a pretty tale of his having espied in the
      lower corridor of the White House, one very rainy day, a young man and
      woman, rather shabbily dressed, who seemed depressed in spirits and anxious
      to consult with some one. Tad called his father’s attention to them, and
      the President went up and asked them what<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_202" id="page_202"></a>{202}</span> they wished. His
      sympathetic manner loosed their tongues and they told him their story.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that the girl was from Virginia and had run away from home to
      marry her lover, an honorably discharged soldier from Indiana. They had
      met by arrangement in Washington, but they were strangers there and very
      unsophisticated, and had little money to pay a minister or spend on hotel
      accommodations; so they had been wandering about the city for hours, not
      knowing where to go, and had taken refuge in the White House from the
      storm. They had no idea that they were talking to the President till he
      made himself known. With characteristic directness, he sent for a
      clergyman of his acquaintance and had the nuptial knot tied in his
      presence. Then he invited bride and groom to remain as his guests till the
      next day, when the weather cleared and they went their way rejoicing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Mrs. Lincoln was the titular head of the President’s household,
      the woman recognized as the social leader of the administration was Kate
      Chase, daughter of the Secretary of the Treasury. She was handsome,
      accomplished, and, after her marriage with William Sprague, the young War
      Governor of Rhode Island, rich as well. Mrs. Lincoln never liked her, but
      the President’s gift for peacemaking came into<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_203" id="page_203"></a>{203}</span> action here, and there was
      no public display of the coolness of feeling between them. Mrs. Sprague
      had a strong taste for politics, and her chief ambition was to see her
      father President; but Lincoln cut off that chance at the critical moment
      by making him Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Among the young and
      rising Congressmen with whom Mrs. Sprague was brought into contact during
      this period was Roscoe Conkling, a Representative from New York, who later
      became a Senator. He was the pink of elegance in person and attire, of
      stately and somewhat condescending manners, and master of the arts of
      verbal expression. They formed a firm friendship which lasted as long as
      both lived. Edgewood, the Chase home on the northern border of the city,
      was for many years one of the show places of Washington, and after Chase’s
      death Conkling procured from Congress an act exempting it from taxation as
      a tribute to the public services of its former owner. Another young
      Representative of whom Mrs. Sprague saw almost as much as of Conkling, but
      liked less, was James G. Blaine of Maine, a brilliant orator who in after
      years became Conkling’s most powerful adversary.
    </p>
    <p>
      A warm friend of Chase’s who used to drop in at Edgewood whenever he was
      in Washington was Horace Greeley, editor of the <i>New York Tribune</i>.
      He was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_204" id="page_204"></a>{204}</span>
      quaint character, who wore his clothes awry and his hair long and always
      tousled. His face he kept clean shaven, but raised a heavy blond beard
      under his chin and jaws; and this, with his ruddy cheeks, blue eyes,
      beaming spectacles, and generally bland aspect, made him look like the
      typical back-country farmer of theatrical tradition. He accentuated the
      peculiarities of his appearance by affecting a large soft hat and not
      spotless white overcoat, the pockets of the latter habitually bulging with
      newspapers. His handwriting was as unconventional as his attire, and
      compositors in the <i>Tribune</i> office had to be specially trained in
      deciphering it, for Mr. Greeley was often unable to read it himself after
      the subject-matter had grown cold in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Greeley was an anti-slavery man, but not an aggressive abolitionist;
      nevertheless he smiled benignantly upon the work of the Hutchinson family
      and took some pains to introduce them in Washington wherever their music
      would be likely to meet with a cordial reception. The Hutchinsons were a
      Massachusetts family of sixteen brothers and sisters, nearly all of them
      bearing Bible names given them by a deeply religious mother. They learned
      as children to lead the singing in the Baptist church attended by their
      parents, and, as their musical fame spread, one of the<span class="pagenum"><a

      brothers developed a talent as a versifier and began writing songs adapted
      to their interpretation, breathing an earnest spirit of patriotism and
      pleading for human freedom. From giving concerts in their native town and
      neighborhood, they gradually essayed more and more ambitious ventures, and
      with Greeley’s aid came under the favorable notice of the administration.
      Lincoln, realizing the appeal their homely entertainments would make to
      the Union volunteers, gave them a roving commission to visit the camps of
      the Army of the Potomac and encouraged them to take in the recruiting
      stations wherever they happened to be. They mixed fun with their
      seriousness in such proportions as they believed would please all classes
      in their audiences; and in their way they did as much to keep the soldiers
      cheerful as Tom Paine had done fourscore years before.
    </p>
    <p>
      So accustomed is the public mind to associating Lincoln and Grant as
      coworkers for the Union cause that few persons suspect that the two men
      never met till the Civil War was three-fourths over. Then, Congress having
      revived the grade of Lieutenant-general of the Army, Grant was ordered to
      Washington to receive his promotion. Arriving early in March, 1864, he
      went at once to the White House, where the President happened to be
      holding a reception in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_206"
      id="page_206"></a>{206}</span> east room. He held back till most of the
      people had passed, when Lincoln, recognizing him from his portraits,
      turned to him with hand outstretched, saying: “This is General Grant, is
      it not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is, Mr. President,” answered Grant. And with this self-introduction,
      fittingly simple, the two great figures of the war faced each other for
      the first time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_207" id="page_207"></a>{207}</span>

    </h2>
    <p class="nind">
      <span class="letra">A</span>LTHOUGH constantly urged to take precautions
      for his own safety, Lincoln never did. He used to walk about the streets
      as freely as any ordinary citizen; and night after night, during the
      darkest period of the war, he would stroll across to Secretary Stanton’s
      office to talk over the latest news from the front. Stanton’s
      remonstrances he would dismiss with a weary smile, protesting that, as far
      as he was aware, he had not an enemy in the world, but if he had, anybody
      who wished to kill him had a hundred chances every day&mdash;so, why be
      uneasy? His second inaugural address was shorter than the first; he wrote
      it about midnight of the third of March, seated in an armchair where he
      was resting after a hard day’s work, and holding the cardboard sheets in
      his lap. Its concluding words were as memorable as those of four years
      before: “With malice toward none, with charity for all, let us go forward
      with the work we have to do: to bind up the nation’s wounds, to care for
      him who has borne the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_208" id="page_208"></a>{208}</span>
      battle and for his widow and his orphan, and to do all things which may
      achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all
      nations.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Early on the fourth, he went to the Capitol quietly and devoted the
      remaining hours of the morning to reading and signing bills. The
      procession which had been arranged to escort him was formed at the White
      House, with the President’s carriage at its head, occupied by Mrs. Lincoln
      and Senators Harlan and Anthony. A platoon of marshals pioneered it, and a
      detachment of the Union Light Guard surrounded it. The crowd, recognizing
      the White House coachman on its box, but not seeing distinctly who sat
      behind, cheered it all along the line under the supposition that it held
      the President. Two companies of colored troops and a lodge of colored Odd
      Fellows were among the marchers, this being the first time that negroes
      ever took part in an inaugural pageant except in some servile capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have already seen how Washington received the news of the final triumph
      of the Federal arms, and how Lincoln fell in the midst of the general
      rejoicing. Many readers of his inaugural address of that year have since
      professed to discern between its written lines a veiled foreboding of the
      end. Certain it is that he was an habitual dreamer, and that one dream,<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_209" id="page_209"></a>{209}</span> which
      came to him on the night before Fort Sumter was bombarded, was repeated on
      the eve of the first battle of Bull Run, and just before other important
      engagements. As he described it, he seemed to be on the water in an
      unfamiliar boat, “moving rapidly toward a dark, indefinite shore.” The
      last recurrence of the dream was in the early morning hours of April 14,
      1865. We shall never know, now, whether it was this or some other portent
      that caused him to say to a trusted companion, not long before his death:
      “I don’t think I shall live to see the end of my term. I try to shake off
      the vision, but it still keeps haunting me.” He had received several
      threatening letters, which he kept in a separate file labeled: “Letters on
      Assassination.” After his death there was found among these a note about
      the very plot in which Booth was the chief actor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fate plays strange tricks. For a few hours that spring, one friend in
      Washington unconsciously held Lincoln’s life in his hand. Harriet Riddle,
      since better known as Mrs. Davis, the novelist, was a pupil at a local
      convent school. Shortly before the tragedy at Ford’s Theater, a teacher
      who had been on a brief visit to a Southern town returned, apparently
      laboring under some terrible excitement which she was trying to suppress.
      At the session of her class immediately<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_210" id="page_210"></a>{210}</span> preceding their separation
      for Good Friday, she suddenly fell upon her knees, bade them all join her
      in prayer, and poured forth, in a voice and manner so agonizing that the
      children were thrilled with a nameless horror, an hysterical appeal for
      divine mercy on the souls who were soon to be called before their Maker
      without warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet, who was an impressionable child, could hardly contain herself
      till she reached home and sought her father, to whom she attempted to
      relate the afternoon’s occurrence. He was the District-attorney, and an
      intimate of the President’s, and was so immersed in the cares of office
      that he put her off till he should have more leisure. When she was
      awakened on Good Friday night by the noise of citizens and soldiers
      hurrying through the streets and calling out the news of the
      assassination, she uttered an exclamation which caught her father’s
      attention, and then he listened to the tale which he had once waved aside.
      “Why did you not tell me this before?” he demanded. It was then too late
      to do more than collect such evidence as he might from the pupils to aid
      the detectives; but the teacher who had uttered that awful prayer had fled
      and could never be traced. No one could longer doubt her guilty knowledge
      of the plot, probably acquired during her visit in the South.<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_211" id="page_211"></a>{211}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The oath with which Vice-president Johnson took upon himself the
      obligations of the Presidency was administered to him at his rooms in the
      Kirkwood House, a hostelry on the Pennsylvania Avenue corner now occupied
      by the Hotel Raleigh. Of his administration, the most broadly interesting
      incident was the impeachment trial described in an earlier chapter; and in
      our reflections on how history is shaped, another personal anecdote seems
      worthy of a place. Its heroine was Miss Vinnie Ream, the sculptor, who
      later became Mrs. Hoxie.
    </p>
    <p>
      As his trial drew near its close, and Johnson’s friends and enemies were
      able to figure out pretty accurately how the Senate was going to divide,
      it became plain that the issue would hang on a single vote. If all the
      Senators counted against the President stood firm, he would be convicted,
      thirty-six to eighteen; but Secretary Stanton insisted that Ross of Kansas
      was preparing to go over from the majority to the minority. Ross was
      occupying a room in the same house with Miss Ream on Capitol Hill, and
      General Daniel E. Sickles, who was acquainted with him, was deputed to see
      him on the night before the roll-call and try to hold him fast against the
      President. Miss Ream happened to meet the General at the door, ushered him
      into the parlor but refused to let him see the Senator,<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_212" id="page_212"></a>{212}</span> and held
      him at bay till dawn the following morning, when he gave up the effort as
      fruitless and went home. If she had weakened for a moment, there is no
      telling what might have happened, for Sickles was in a position to have
      brought very heavy pressure to bear upon Ross. The roll-call showed
      thirty-five for conviction to nineteen against&mdash;less than the
      two-thirds required to convict; and it was Ross’s vote that saved Johnson.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the inauguration of Grant, the relations between him and the retiring
      President were so strained, owing to the recent struggle at the War
      Department, that Johnson refused to attend the ceremonies unless it could
      be arranged that he and Grant should ride in separate carriages. General
      Rawlins therefore acted as escort to Grant and Vice-president Colfax.
      Grant was not much of a speaker, but the delivery of his inaugural address
      is remembered for a pretty incident. His little daughter Nellie, confused
      by the continuous bustle all about her, obeyed on the platform the same
      childish impulse which moved her in any exigency at home, and, running to
      his side, nestled against him, clasping one of his hands in both of hers
      and holding it all the time he was speaking. At the ball that evening,
      access to the supper-room and to the cloak-room was by the same door,
      which caused a blockade in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_213"
      id="page_213"></a>{213}</span> passage. The servants in charge of the
      wraps became hopelessly demoralized, with the result that Horace Greeley
      had to wait two hours to recover his white overcoat and lost his hat
      entirely. The torrent of lurid expletives he let loose during his ordeal
      shared space and importance, in the next day’s newspapers, with the
      thirty-five thousand dollars’ worth of diamonds worn by Mrs. John
      Morrissey, wife of the prize-fighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant’s second inauguration began inauspiciously, his aged father falling
      down a flight of stairs at the Capitol and suffering injuries which
      finally caused his death. The day was stormy, and the evening the coldest
      known in Washington for years. Unfortunately, the only place where the
      ball could be held was an improvised wooden building, through the crevices
      of which the icy wind blew a gale; and, to complete everybody’s misery,
      the heating apparatus broke down, so that many of the ladies who had come
      in conventional toilets had to protect their shoulders with fur mantillas,
      while their escorts put on overcoats. The President was so cold that he
      forgot the figures in the state quadrille which he was to lead, and was
      obliged to depend on General Sherman to push him through them. The supper
      was ruined, the meats and salads competing in temperature with the ices;
      all<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_214" id="page_214"></a>{214}</span>
      that could be saved was the coffee, which was kept hot over alcohol lamps.
      The breath of the members of the band congealed in their instruments, and
      several hundred canaries which were to sing in the intervals between band
      pieces shriveled into little downy balls on the bottoms of their cages and
      uttered not a trill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key-note of Grant’s administration on its political side was his
      steadfast faith that any friend of his was capable of filling any office
      in his gift. He named Alexander T. Stewart, the New York dry-goods
      merchant, for Secretary of the Treasury, but had to let him resign on
      account of technical objections raised in the Senate. Wendell Phillips
      having come to his defense at a hostile mass-meeting in Boston, Grant
      wished to make him Minister to England, but the offer was declined because
      Mrs. Phillips would not be able to go abroad at that time. Caleb Cushing
      of Massachusetts, though a stanch Democrat before the war, had become an
      “administration man” as soon as the Union was threatened, and thereby
      aroused the admiration of Grant, who named him for Chief Justice after
      Chase’s death; but the same political independence which so won Grant had
      incensed a number of Senators, who caused the rejection of the nomination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, however, Grant succeeded in sending Cushing<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_215" id="page_215"></a>{215}</span> as Minister to Spain.
      Cushing was a man full of peculiarities, which strengthened with his
      years. At an early age he discarded the umbrella as a nuisance and braved
      storms unprotected. Naturally his hats suffered. At the time he received
      his billet for Spain, he was wearing one of the chimney-pot variety,
      which, from its appearance, he must have bought many years before. The nap
      was a good deal worn, there was a slight bulge in the top, and, thanks to
      the squareness of his head, he could wear it with either side in front.
      When some one suggested that he had better buy a new hat before presenting
      himself at the Spanish court, he considered the question solemnly, turning
      the old hat around and examining it with care before answering: “No, I
      think I shall wait and see what the fashions are in Madrid.” Though ready
      to spend his money freely for any public purpose, in private indulgences
      the frugal notions inherited from his New England ancestry came to the
      front. Hardly anybody ever saw him light a fresh cigar, but he used to
      carry about in his pocket a case packed with partly consumed stumps, to
      one of which he would help himself when he wished a smoke, only to let it
      die again as soon as he had become interested in talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was because of his liking for both Blaine and Conkling that Grant
      strove, as his last act in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_216"
      id="page_216"></a>{216}</span> White House, to reconcile the two men, who
      were intensely hostile to each other. Their quarrel had grown out of a
      passage in debate when Conkling had made some very sarcastic comments on
      Blaine. The latter retorted in kind. “The contempt of that large-minded
      gentleman,” said he, glancing toward Conkling, “is so wilting, his haughty
      disdain, his grandiloquent swell, his majestic, supereminent,
      overpowering, turkey-gobbler strut have been so crushing to myself and all
      the members of this House, that I know it was an act of temerity for me to
      venture upon a controversy with him.” Referring to a recent newspaper
      article in which Conkling had been likened to the late Henry Winter Davis,
      Blaine went on: “The gentleman took it seriously, and it has given his
      strut additional pomposity. The resemblance is great. It is striking.
      Hyperion to a satyr, Thersites to Hercules, mud to marble, a dunghill to a
      diamond, a singed cat to a Bengal tiger, a whining puppy to a roaring
      lion!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Conkling never forgave this attack. It seems like a small thing to change
      the whole current of a nation’s history, but it probably cost Blaine the
      Presidency; for in 1884 the disaffection of the Republicans in Conkling’s
      old home in central New York gave the State to Cleveland. President
      Grant’s effort to bring the foes together failed because Blaine, though
      ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_217" id="page_217"></a>{217}</span>
      make any ordinary concessions, balked when Conkling demanded that he
      should confess his “mud to marble” speech to have been “unqualifiedly and
      maliciously false.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1874, Miss Nellie Grant was married to Algernon Sartoris, a British
      subject. She was her father’s pet. At her wedding, he stood beside his
      wife to receive the guests, his face wearing a sphinx-like calm, though
      every one knew how he would feel the parting soon to follow. His forced
      composure continued till Nellie had left the house with her husband, and
      then he disappeared. An old friend, seeking him up-stairs, tapped at his
      chamber door, and, as there was no response, pushed it slightly ajar and
      looked in. There, on the bed, face downward, his eyes buried in his hands
      and his whole frame shaken with grief, lay the great soldier, sobbing like
      a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the Grant administration, the social arbiter for Washington was
      Mrs. Hamilton Fish, wife of the Secretary of State. She was a woman of the
      world, broad-minded and efficient, but the White House was not a very
      ceremonious place in that era. When the new Danish Minister called, for
      instance, in full regalia, to present his credentials, he found no one
      prepared to receive him, even the negro boy who met him at the door having
      to hurry into a coat before ushering<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_218" id="page_218"></a>{218}</span> him in. Persons who
      attended the state dinners say that Grant often turned down his
      wine-glasses. It was, as far as I have ever heard, the first instance of a
      President’s doing this; and it paved the way for the reign of cold water
      which came in with the next President, Rutherford B. Hayes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hayes entered office under cloudy auspices. His competitor for the
      Presidency was Samuel J. Tilden, a powerful Democratic leader. In some of
      the Southern States which were still in the throes of reconstruction,
      United States troops were doing police duty, the Governors were appointees
      of a Republican President, and the election machinery was in the hands of
      Republican office-holders, though the bulk of the white voting population
      was Democratic. In these States the official canvassers had reported the
      Republican electors chosen, the electors had cast their ballots for Hayes,
      and the Governors had signed and forwarded their certificates accordingly,
      in defiance of Democratic protests that the returns were fictitious.
      Without these States, the Democratic candidate had one hundred and
      eighty-four of the one hundred and eighty-five electoral votes necessary
      to a choice, while the Republican candidate could win only with their aid;
      so a single electoral vote would tip the scale either way. The duty of
      opening the certificates and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_219"

      announcing the results devolved upon the President of the Senate, a strong
      Republican.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Democrats made so serious charges of falsification of the records that
      the whole country became much excited, and fears were entertained in
      Congress that another civil war might be impending. In the midst of the
      turmoil, a joint committee of both chambers worked out a plan for a
      bi-partisan Electoral Commission, to consist of five Senators, five
      Representatives, and five Justices of the Supreme Court, before whom all
      the questions at issue should be argued by counsel, and whose decisions
      should place the result beyond immediate appeal. The Commission, as made
      up, contained eight Republicans and seven Democrats, and its decisions
      were always given by a vote of eight to seven. It held its sessions in the
      room now occupied by the Supreme Court, where it began its work on
      February 1, 1877, and at the end of a month rendered its last ruling,
      which gave the Presidency to Mr. Hayes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the fourth of March was to fall on Sunday, President Grant had Hayes
      meet Chief Justice Waite in the red parlor of the White House on the
      evening of the third and take the oath privately. The inaugural ball was
      omitted because the Electoral Commission had finished its work too late to
      enable preparations<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_220" id="page_220"></a>{220}</span>
      to be made. President Hayes was not nearly so conspicuous a figure during
      the following four years as his wife, who was a woman of very positive
      convictions, especially on the subject of alcoholic stimulants. At her
      instance, wines were banished from the White House table, the only
      exception occurring when the Grand Dukes Alexis and Constantin of Russia
      visited Washington. It is said to have been some incident at the
      entertainment given in their honor which fixed Mr. and Mrs. Hayes
      definitely in the determination not to depart again from the rule of
      teetotalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newspapers poked a good deal of innocent fun at the Hayes parties on
      the score that, though the ban was never lifted from the ordinary
      intoxicants drunk from glasses, there was always plenty of strong Roman
      punch served in orange-skins. The nickname which presently fastened itself
      to this deceptive course was the “life-saving station.” In his diary,
      however, Mr. Hayes has left us the statement: “The joke of the Roman punch
      oranges was not on us, but on the drinking people. My orders were to
      flavor them rather strongly with the same flavor that is found in Jamaica
      rum. This took! It was refreshing to hear the drinkers say, with a smack
      of their lips, ‘Would they were hot!’” I am bound to add that, in spite of
      the good man’s enjoyment of his ruse, the suspicion still<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_221" id="page_221"></a>{221}</span> survives
      that his steward used to put a private and particular interpretation on
      his orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Mr. Hayes was not a member of any church, his wife was an ardent
      Methodist, and one marked feature of their life in Washington was the
      Sunday evening sociables at the White House, when Cabinet officers and
      other dignitaries would come in and pass a couple of hours singing hymns,
      with light conversation between. Among the most interested attendants at
      these gatherings was General Sherman, who used to join vigorously in the
      singing&mdash;or try to. Another, who was destined to play an independent
      part in history a few years afterward, was a clever young Congressman from
      Ohio named William McKinley, Junior. He had been a volunteer soldier in
      Hayes’s regiment early in the war, and they had grown to be fast friends.
      At one of the first of the secular receptions during the Hayes régime, the
      guest of honor was a budding celebrity, Queen Liliuokalani of Hawaii. She
      labored under the handicap of knowing no English, and had to carry on most
      of her conversation through an interpreter.
    </p>
    <p>
      President Hayes provoked a good deal of criticism among the Southerners in
      Washington by appointing Frederick Douglass, the negro ex-slave and
      orator, United States Marshal of the District, for the office<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_222" id="page_222"></a>{222}</span> had up
      to that time carried with it the duties of a sort of majordomo at the
      President’s receptions, including the presentation of the guests. A
      visitor to Washington about these days who did not attend the state
      receptions, but held some of his own in the open air, was a man of small
      and unimpressive stature, with black hair and mustache and a rather
      good-natured face, whose portrait appeared repeatedly in the illustrated
      papers, and whose name carried with it a certain terror to timid souls who
      expected to see him launch a social revolution. This was Dennis Kearney,
      who had made himself notorious by his speeches in the sand-lots of San
      Francisco, declaring that “the Chinese must go,” and denouncing every one,
      regardless of race, who had been thrifty enough to accumulate any of this
      world’s goods. His remarkable coinage of words and generally unique
      English gave currency to a multitude of epigrammatic phrases, which for
      several years were known as “Kearneyisms.”
    </p>
    <p>
      All through the campaign of 1880 a great deal was made of the sayings and
      doings of “Grandma Garfield,” the mother of the Republican candidate: an
      old lady of a type rarely seen now, who was not ashamed of her years, wore
      her cap and spectacles as badges of distinction, and never forgot that,
      however great he might have grown, her son was still her son. Nor did<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_223" id="page_223"></a>{223}</span> he
      forget it; and on the east portico of the Capitol, with his assent to the
      constitutional oath barely off his lips, his first act as President was to
      bend down and kiss her. The inauguration was notable, too, for the
      important part taken in the parade by the defeated competitor for the
      Presidency, General Winfield S. Hancock. He was a splendid-looking man and
      a superb horseman, and in his uniform as a Major-general was the most
      imposing object in the procession. The spectators, delighted with his
      sportsmanlike spirit, paid him as hearty a tribute as they paid the
      President.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few weeks after the inauguration, a fierce quarrel broke out over the
      distribution of federal patronage, splitting the Republican party into two
      factions. The angry irruptions of the newspapers on both sides, which
      would have passed with any normal mind for what they were worth, made a
      more serious impression on that of Charles J. Guiteau, a degenerate with a
      craving for self-advertisement; and, failing in his attempt to obtain an
      office for himself, he saw in the controversy an opportunity to pose as a
      hero by removing its cause. Garfield, as a graduate of Williams College,
      had arranged to attend the next commencement, and was in the railway
      station on the second of July, 1881, on the way to his train, when he was
      approached by Guiteau from behind and shot.<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_224" id="page_224"></a>{224}</span> He lingered, first in the
      White House and later at Elberon, New Jersey, whither he was taken after
      the weather became too sultry in Washington, till the nineteenth of
      September. The assassin was brought to trial at the winter term of the
      Supreme Court of the District, convicted of murder, and hanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the day of Garfield’s death, the Vice-president, Chester
      A. Arthur, was sworn in at his home in New York City, in the presence of
      his son and a few personal friends, including Elihu Root. A more formal
      administration of the oath took place in the Vice-president’s room at the
      Capitol in Washington three days later, Chief Justice Waite officiating,
      with Associate Justices Harlan and Matthews, General Grant, and several
      Senators and Representatives as witnesses. After signing the oath, Arthur
      read a brief address and returned at once to his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur was a widower, and his only daughter was still too young to take
      full charge of his household affairs, so his sister, Mrs. McElroy,
      presided at all his social functions. He was very fond of music, and the
      great operatic and concert stars were always sure of a warm welcome from
      him when they passed through Washington. The finest of his dinners was
      that which he gave for Christine Nilsson. As the company rose from the
      table and he offered his arm to escort<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_225" id="page_225"></a>{225}</span> her back to the east room,
      the Marine Band in the corridor, responding to a secret signal, began
      playing one of her favorite airs, and, with the spontaneous delight of a
      child, she fell to singing it, her voice soaring bird-like above the
      instruments as she walked. This surprise for Miss Nilsson was typical of
      the graceful things Arthur was fond of doing, and in which he set the pace
      for the members of his official family. Ex-president Grant and his wife,
      on their return from their tour of the world, dropped in upon Washington,
      as it chanced, just when a reception was about to be held at the White
      House. Arthur sent his carriage for them. Mrs. Frelinghuysen, wife of the
      Secretary of State, was on that occasion filling Mrs. McElroy’s accustomed
      station next to the President in the receiving line; but on the entrance
      of the distinguished guests she withdrew, gently pressing Mrs. Grant into
      her place as hostess of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the first Democratic President since the war, Grover Cleveland of New
      York found a hard task laid out for him. He realized that he owed his
      election chiefly to the reform element in both the great parties, yet it
      was his own party that claimed him, and, having been out of power for a
      quarter-century, it was not over-modest in its demands. His efforts at
      tariff reduction stirred the protectionists to such activity in<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_226" id="page_226"></a>{226}</span> the next
      campaign that Benjamin Harrison of Indiana, a Republican and a grandson of
      “Old Tippecanoe,” was elected in November, 1888. When he entered office,
      Cleveland was a bachelor forty-eight years old. In June, 1886, he married
      Miss Frances Folsom, the daughter of a former law partner to whom he had
      been warmly attached. The wedding ceremony was performed in the White
      House, only a small party of friends attending. Mrs. Cleveland, who was
      young and of attractive presence, made friends for herself on every side
      and did much to soften the antagonisms which her husband’s course in
      office necessarily aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk of the weather seemed to have been storing his rain for weeks in
      order to let it all out upon Harrison’s inauguration, and the street
      pageant was a drenched and draggled affair. The civilities of the outgoing
      to the incoming President gave the day its one touch of cheerfulness.
      Cleveland sat on the rear seat of the open landau which bore them to the
      Capitol, the front seat being occupied by Senators Hoar and Cockrell,
      acting as a committee of escort. In order to enable Harrison to lift his
      hat to the people who cheered him from the sidewalk, Cleveland raised his
      own umbrella and held it over his companion. When Cockrell undertook to do
      the same for Hoar, his umbrella broke. Cleveland at once borrowed an
      umbrella<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_227" id="page_227"></a>{227}</span>
      of his Secretary of the Treasury in the next carriage, and, when Mr. Hoar
      demurred, reassured him with a laugh: “Don’t be alarmed, Senator; we’re
      honest, and I’ll see that it gets back!” As they drove down the Avenue,
      most of the applause, naturally, was for the President-elect; but once in
      a while a spectator would shout, “Good-by, Grover!” or something of the
      sort, and Cleveland would return the greeting with a smile and a nod. So
      much kindly feeling was manifested throughout the morning that Harrison,
      who was temperamentally the least effusive of men, was deeply touched; and
      he could not forbear referring in his inaugural address to the courtesy he
      had received at Cleveland’s hands, adding that he should endeavor to show
      like consideration to his successor four years later.
    </p>
    <p>
      And four years later Providence gave him the chance, which he improved as
      far as in him lay. In the meantime he had passed through many sad
      experiences. Factional divisions, almost as serious as those that
      culminated in the assassination of Garfield, had broken up his party. His
      Secretary of State, Mr. Blaine, had parted company with him on the eve of
      the meeting of the Republican National Convention of 1892, become his
      rival for the Presidential nomination, and died the following winter. Two
      of Blaine’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_228" id="page_228"></a>{228}</span>
      sons and one of his daughters had already died. Mr. Windom, Secretary of
      the Treasury, had fallen dead at a public banquet, just after finishing a
      memorable speech in defense of the administration. General Tracy,
      Secretary of the Navy, had lost his wife and daughter in a fire which
      destroyed their Washington home. The wife of the President’s secretary,
      Mr. Halford, had died; and to crown his load of sorrows, Mr. Harrison lost
      his own wife and her father almost at the time of his defeat for
      reëlection.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, he had enjoyed the presence in the White House of his
      daughter, Mrs. McKee, with her two children, one of whom, a bright little
      boy named in his honor, was his special favorite and playfellow out of
      office hours. The south garden was the scene of many of their frolics,
      which recalled the legends about John Adams and his juvenile tyrant. One
      incident will never be forgotten by those who witnessed it. “Baby McKee,”
      as Benjamin junior was commonly called, used to drive a goat before his
      little wagon. This amusement was confined, as a rule, to occasions when
      the President could be near at hand to watch proceedings, for the goat was
      an erratic brute. One day it caught the President napping and started at
      full gallop for an open gate. Mr. Harrison, suddenly awakened to the
      situation, dashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_229" id="page_229"></a>{229}</span>
      after. The goat succeeded in pulling the wagon through the narrow aperture
      without a collision, but, once in the street, bolted straight for a trench
      in which workmen were laying a pipe. By a succession of mighty leaps, such
      as probably no dignitary of his rank had ever made before, Mr. Harrison
      contrived to get in front of the animal, seize it by the bit, and swing it
      around in the nick of time to prevent its jumping the excavation and
      tumbling wagon and boy into the mud at the bottom. The President was
      puffing hard as he returned triumphantly to the White House, dragging the
      reluctant goat by the headstall, under a running fire of complaints from
      his grandson for spoiling the morning ride.
    </p>

      When Mr. and Mrs. Cleveland came back in 1893, they brought with them
      their infant daughter Ruth, and open gates in the south garden of the
      White House became at once a thing of the past; for the garden was the
      child’s only playground, and an epidemic of kidnapping had recently broken
      out. For further security, and in order to have one place where his
      domestic hours would be free from business interruptions, the President
      rented the small estate known as Woodley, in one of the northwestern
      suburbs. Here he lived during the greater part of the year, driving in
      daily to his work and spending a night in Washington<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_230" id="page_230"></a>{230}</span> now and then if necessary.
      By that time the official encroachments on the family space of the White
      House had reached a point where either the building must be enlarged or a
      separate dwelling provided for the President. A scheme of enlargement had
      been broached in Harrison’s term, but the plans drawn under Mrs.
      Harrison’s direction changed the shape of the old mansion in too many
      essential features to win the approval of the architects consulted, and
      the matter was dropped. The Clevelands, by living at Woodley, escaped some
      of the cramping the Harrisons had suffered, and the McKinleys, who came in
      next, got along pretty well because they had no children.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Senator La Follette once said, McKinley never had a fair chance as
      President to show what was in him: his first term was broken into by the
      Spanish War, and his second was cut off almost at its beginning by
      assassination. He was sweet-natured and a born manager of men, and no one
      who ever filled the Presidential chair left behind him a more fragrant
      memory. As his murder occurred in Buffalo, and Czolgosz, who killed him,
      was tried and put to death there, the episode serves our present purpose
      only in leading up to the accession of Theodore Roosevelt of New York, the
      Vice-president, who was recalled from a summer vacation in the mountains
      to take the head of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_231"
      id="page_231"></a>{231}</span> state. His inauguration was of the simplest
      sort, at the house of a friend in Buffalo, where some members of the
      McKinley Cabinet and a few other gentlemen met to witness the
      administration of the oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first few months in the White House convinced the new President that
      something must be done without delay to relieve the building, which had
      become not only inconvenient but dangerous. For several years, when
      repairs had been found necessary, they had been made by temporary
      patchwork, with little reference to their effect on anything else; not a
      few of the floor timbers subject to most strain were badly rotted, and
      others stood in so perilous relations to the lighting apparatus that only
      by a miracle had the house escaped destruction by fire. Fortunately
      Congress had begun to show some interest in a long-mooted project for
      bringing the city back to the plan laid out by L’Enfant; and a generous
      appropriation was procured for making over the White House to resemble as
      nearly as practicable the President’s Palace built by Hoban. All the
      latter half of 1902 was given to this work. The office was moved out of
      the main building and planted in a little house of its own on the same
      spot where Jefferson used to have his workroom, at the extremity of the
      western terrace. The eastern terrace, of which nothing but the buried
      foundations remained, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_232"
      id="page_232"></a>{232}</span> rebuilt, and so arranged as to afford an
      entrance for guests at the larger receptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside of the main house, the old lines were kept intact as far as the
      comfort of its occupants would permit, though the restoration did work
      some changes. The noble east room, which for many years was decorated in
      the style of the saloon of a river steamboat, wears now the air of simple
      elegance designed for it before steamboats were invented; and the state
      dining-room has been so enlarged that future Presidents will not be
      forced, on especially great occasions, to spread their tables in the east
      room in order to spare the diners the annoyance of bumping elbows.
      Upstairs the changes have been rather of function than of form. The room
      which, from Grant’s day to McKinley’s, was used for Cabinet meetings, and
      where our peace protocol with Spain was signed, is now a library; that in
      which Lincoln read to his official family the first draft of his
      Emancipation Proclamation is now a bedroom, and a like fate has befallen
      the former library, where Cleveland penned his Venezuela message. The old
      lines of partition, however, are all there. Logs still blaze and crackle
      in the fireplace beside which Jackson puffed his corncob pipe. The windows
      through which Lincoln looked over at the Virginia hills have not changed
      even the shape or size of their old-fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_233" id="page_233"></a>{233}</span> panes. The places where our
      first royal guest slept, and where Garfield passed his long ordeal of
      suffering, remain bedchambers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roosevelt, who loved the White House and had made a study of its
      architectural history, personally supervised every stage of its
      restoration. When the alterations were finished, she took the same
      interest in the process of refurnishing, so that the final product was, as
      nearly as modern conditions would permit, the White House of a century
      ago. The removal of needless obstructions was one of the most successful
      elements in the renovation, as it made possible the handling of a crowd of
      fifteen hundred or two thousand people without confusion. Socially, the
      Roosevelt administration was in every way the most brilliant Washington
      has ever known. Mrs. Roosevelt was a perfect hostess, and the many-sided
      President drew about him the leaders in every line of thought and action.
      In his democracy of companionship and his forceful way of doing whatever
      he laid his hand to, he was another Jackson; in his attraction for men of
      letters, students of statecraft, artists, and scientific workers, he
      revived the best traditions of Jefferson.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four years of Taft are too fresh in the public memory to call for
      extended mention. Taft was forced to have his inauguration in the Senate
      Chamber on<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_234" id="page_234"></a>{234}</span>
      account of the execrable weather, for the worst blizzard prevailed on the
      fourth of March, 1909, that had visited Washington for ten years. The
      railroads leading into the city were blockaded, so that many passengers
      who had come from a distance to attend the ceremony were compelled to
      forsake their trains a mile or more from their destination and plow their
      own way in, as the sole alternative of camping in the cars for an
      indefinite number of hours. Only by the utmost diligence on the part of
      the municipal laborers were the streets kept in condition for the parade
      to pass, and most of the spectators’ stands erected on the sidewalks were
      utterly deserted. Mr. Roosevelt having announced, some time before, his
      intention to leave for New York as soon as he had seen his successor sworn
      in, Mrs. Taft made the drive between the Capitol and the White House by
      her husband’s side.

    <p>
      Woodrow Wilson of New Jersey, the next President, signalized his advent by
      notifying the citizens of Washington that he did not wish any inaugural
      ball, and the preparations already under way were abandoned. His
      administration is still writing its own history.<span class="pagenum"><a

    </h2>
    <p class="nind">
      <span class="letra">N</span>O American city has suburbs more interesting
      than Washington’s. Those that hold first rank, naturally, are on the
      Virginia side of the Potomac, the region most redolent of the memory of
      the great patriot whose name was given to the capital. The Arlington
      estate, which lies nearest, was never the home of George Washington, but
      he visited it often, for it belonged by inheritance to the grandson of his
      wife by her earlier marriage; and George and Martha were so pleased with
      it that they built a little summer-house about where the flagstaff now
      stands, whence they could overlook the work going on in the new federal
      city across the river. Young George Custis, owner of the place, built the
      spacious dwelling substantially as we now find it, finishing it four years
      after Washington’s death. He left the property to his daughter Mary, who
      in 1831 became the wife of Robert E. Lee, then a lieutenant in the regular
      army, but thirty years later commander-in-chief of the Confederate<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_236" id="page_236"></a>{236}</span> forces.
      Their wedding took place in the old drawing-room, where visitors now
      register their names.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lee had just reached colonel’s rank when the Civil War broke out. He was
      opposed to secession, but, faithful to the traditions of State sovereignty
      in which he had been trained, decided that it was his duty to sacrifice
      all other ties and follow the fortunes of Virginia. After a painful
      interview with General Scott, who strove vainly to shake his resolution,
      he wrote, in the library across the hall from the drawing-room, his
      resignation of his commission in the United States army. Then, accompanied
      by his family, he set out for the South, never to return. In a few days
      the Federal troops took possession of the estate as important to the
      protection of Washington. Here McClellan worked out his plans for the
      reorganization of the Union army following the Bull Run disaster. A few
      years afterward, there being no one at hand to pay the war-tax laid on the
      land, it was sold under the hammer, and the Government bid it in. Before
      the sale had been definitely ordered, a Northern relative of the Lees came
      forward with an offer to pay the levy and costs, but the tax commissioners
      declined the tender on the ground that the delinquent taxpayer had not
      made it in person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the house had been turned into a military<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_237" id="page_237"></a>{237}</span> hospital, and the patients
      who died there were buried close by. When it became necessary to have a
      soldiers’ burial-ground near Washington, Quartermaster-general Meigs was
      permitted to lay off two hundred acres of the estate for the purpose. This
      was the beginning of the National Cemetery of to-day, where about eighteen
      thousand soldiers and sailors have found a last resting-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time after the war, General Lee’s son brought suit for the recovery
      of the property and won it, the Supreme Court holding that the tax
      commissioners ought to have accepted the tender made them; but Mr. Lee
      compromised with the Government, conveying to it his interest for one
      hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Since then the house has been put into
      excellent repair, and the land about it suitably enclosed and improved. On
      the upper edge of the estate has been established the military post known
      as Fort Myer, where cavalry-training is carried to a high point, weather
      observations are made, and a wireless telegraph station exchanges
      despatches with the Eiffel tower in Paris. Some of the land down by the
      river has been made over into an experimental farm under the auspices of
      the Department of Agriculture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily, the Cemetery has been kept free from tawdry memorials and
      inconsequential ornament, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_238"
      id="page_238"></a>{238}</span> enveloped in an atmosphere of dignity well
      fitting its sacred character. Its most impressive tomb is that dedicated
      to the Unknown Dead, which contains the remains of more than two thousand
      soldiers found on various battlefields but never identified. “Their names
      and deaths,” says the inscription, “are recorded in the archives of their
      country, and its grateful citizens honor them as their noble army of
      martyrs.” Not far away is a fine amphitheater with a carpet of turf and a
      canopy of trellised vines, where memorial exercises are held annually on
      Decoration Day, the President almost always taking part. There is also a
      Temple of Fame, bearing the names of Washington and Lincoln, with those of
      the military leaders who particularly distinguished themselves in the
      Civil War. An extension has recently been made in the grounds devoted to
      sepulture, where the most conspicuous monument is that which commemorates
      the tragedy of the battleship <i>Maine</i> in Havana harbor. The base is
      built to represent a gun-turret on the deck of a man-of-war; on this are
      inscribed the names of the victims, while from the center of the turret
      rises a mast with a fighting-top. A larger and more ambitious
      amphitheater, also, has been laid out in the extension.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Arlington we can go, by the same road that Washington trod on his
      trips, to Alexandria, a town<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_239"
      id="page_239"></a>{239}</span> which fairly reeks with associations, from
      the colonial names of some of its streets&mdash;King, Queen, Prince,
      Princess, Duke, Duchess, Royal&mdash;to its remnants of cobblestone
      pavement laid by the Hessian prisoners in the Revolution. Here is the old
      Carlyle mansion, where General Braddock had his headquarters before
      starting on his ill-fated expedition against the French and Indians. In
      its blue drawing-room Washington, as a young surveyor ambitious to serve
      his king, received the first rudiments of his military education; and at
      the foot of yonder staircase one evening stood the same Washington,
      expectant, while pretty Sally Fairfax tripped lightly down to join him and
      be led through the opening cotillion at her coming-out ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      This must have been a splendid mansion in its time, with a terraced garden
      descending to the river-bank, and a fountain in the midst of the
      flower-beds. It was built on the ruins of a fort used by the early
      settlers against the Indians; the living-rooms of the fort became the
      cellar of the mansion, and the fort proper the plaza, upon which the main
      hallway opens. You enter the house now through a cozy little tea-room
      established by a group of young ladies of Alexandria; and it may be your
      good fortune to be shown about the premises by one of them who is herself
      a member<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_240" id="page_240"></a>{240}</span>
      of the historic Carlyle and Fairfax families and familiar with all their
      ancestral tales.
    </p>
    <p>
      A prominent site in town is covered by Christ Church, where Washington
      worshiped, and where you can see the square family pew for which he paid
      the record price, thirty-six pounds and ten shillings. The church stands
      in a large, old-fashioned yard, sprinkled with the gravestones of men and
      women of local renown. Hither, on Sundays, drove the ladies from Mount
      Vernon, seven miles away, in a chariot with a mahogany body, green
      Venetian blinds, and pictured panels, drawn by four horses. The General
      did not take kindly to the coach for himself, but rode beside it on his
      favorite saddle-horse, followed at a respectful distance by Bishop, his
      colored body-servant, in scarlet livery. After service he would linger in
      the churchyard, chatting with his friends, till Bishop reminded him of the
      flight of time by bringing up his horse and holding the stirrup for him to
      mount.
    </p>
    <p>
      A spirited historical controversy has been waged over the question of
      Washington’s attitude toward religion. The weight of evidence favors the
      idea that, though not bound by dogma, he had a broad faith in the
      philosophy of Christianity, always knelt with the rest of the congregation
      and joined in the responses, and occasionally remained for the communion.
      He<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_241" id="page_241"></a>{241}</span>
      certainly encouraged his slaves to believe in the efficacy of prayer; for
      once, when a long-continued drought threatened to ruin his crops, he
      called his farm-hands together on Sunday morning and bade them put up
      their united supplication for rain. They did so, and to their great
      delight the flood-gates of heaven suddenly opened and deluged the earth;
      but the Washington family were caught in the storm on their way home from
      church, and could not make shelter soon enough to save Mrs. Washington’s
      best gown from serious damage or the General from being soaked to the
      skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his younger days, Washington was fond of dancing, and used to come into
      town to attend assemblies at Clagett’s Tavern. The assembly-hall was
      up-stairs. It was afterward divided into three rooms, one of which, having
      fallen into the hands of persons who respect its pedigree, has been pretty
      well preserved. In the old times it had at one end a gallery for the
      musicians, accessible only by a ladder, which was removed as soon as they
      were all in their places. This arrangement was designed to compel them to
      stay at their work till released, and to drink only what was passed up to
      them with the approval of the floor-committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the corridor from the old assembly-hall was<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_242" id="page_242"></a>{242}</span> a chamber that later became
      interesting through its occupancy by an unknown woman who came to the
      tavern one morning in 1816, plainly in ill health. She was accompanied by
      a few servants, with whom she conversed only in French, and neither she
      nor they could be drawn into any communication with other persons, except
      what was necessary to engage accommodations and order meals. On the fourth
      day of her stay, there appeared on the scene a strange man, who from
      various indications was assumed to be her husband. An hour after his
      arrival she died in his arms. He buried her in St. Paul’s cemetery on the
      outskirts of the town, planting a willow-tree over her grave, and raising
      at its head a stone inscribed to the memory simply of “A Female Stranger,”
      with this stanza from Pope’s “Unfortunate Lady”:
    </p>
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
          <span class="i0">“How loved, how honored once, avails thee not,<br /></span>
          <span class="i1">To whom related, or by whom begot.<br /></span> <span
          class="i1">A heap of dust alone remains of thee,<br /></span> <span
          class="i1">’Tis all thou art, and all the proud shall be.”<br /></span>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="nind">
      And the Female Stranger remains a mystery to this day, though many efforts
      have been made to discover her identity. A local suspicion that she was
      Theodosia Allston, the daughter of Aaron Burr, seems to be discredited by
      the fact that Theodosia’s disappearance occurred in 1812, and that her
      husband was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_243" id="page_243"></a>{243}</span>
      dead long before the Stranger came to Clagett’s Tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      How public-spirited a citizen Washington was is attested by his having
      laid the foundation of Alexandria’s free-school system, presented the town
      with its first fire-engine, organized its first militia company, and got
      up a lottery to raise a fund for improving the country roads thereabout.
      He was an earnest Freemason, and the lodge named for him owns a number of
      relics like the chair in which he presided as Master, his apron, his
      wedding gloves, his spurs, his pruning-knife, and a penknife which his
      mother gave him when he was eleven years old and which he carried till he
      died. It has also the last authentic portrait of him taken from life, a
      pastel done by William Williams of Philadelphia.
    </p>
    <p>
      In and around Alexandria are other points of interest, including the house
      in which Colonel Ellsworth was killed, and one where, it is said, Martha
      Washington secreted herself for a while during her widowhood for fear of a
      slave uprising; a theological seminary which has graduated, among other
      eminent divines, Bishops Phillips Brooks of Boston and Henry C. Potter of
      New York; and the nearly obliterated remains of the road which, in 1765,
      General Braddock began to build into the West.<span class="pagenum"><a

    <p>
      We can go to Mount Vernon by boat, or over a road which Congress has
      repeatedly, but without effect, been petitioned to acquire and improve.
      Already a trolley company has recognized a public demand and is running
      cars on a regular schedule from the heart of the capital city to the
      borders of Washington’s old estate. On the way down we pass Wellington,
      once the home of Tobias Lear, whom General Washington hired for two
      hundred dollars a year to act as tutor to the children at Mount Vernon,
      promoting him later to the post of private secretary. In both capacities,
      his employer provided, he “will sit at my table, will live as I live, will
      mix with the company who resort to the house, and will be treated in every
      respect with courtesy and proper attention.” Lear married three wives, one
      of them a kinswoman of the General’s. He acquired means, removed in later
      life to Washington, and became a merchant with a warehouse on the river.
      His tombstone in the Congressional Cemetery recites an overflowing list of
      his virtues and honors, and posterity owes him a large debt for having
      preserved many of the Washingtoniana most valued now by historians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mount Vernon became the property of the Washington family by a grant from
      Lord Culpepper in 1670 to John Washington, the great-grandfather of
      George.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_245" id="page_245"></a>{245}</span>
      It was christened in honor of Admiral Vernon, a friend of Lawrence
      Washington, the half-brother who brought George up and superintended his
      education. George, who received it by inheritance, willed it to his nephew
      Bushrod, he to his nephew John, and John to a son of the same name.
      Financial embarrassments led the last heir to part with some of the land;
      but to an area of a few hundred acres, including the mansion, the family

      be made for its purchase by the Mount Vernon Ladies’ Association, a
      society of patriotic women who, with money privately raised, have restored
      the place and kept it in order ever since. There is good reason to doubt
      whether this would ever have come about but for the heroic energy of Miss
      Ann Pamela Cunningham of South Carolina, who, though a confirmed invalid,
      devised and executed a plan which saved the estate from being sold to a
      professional showman.

      Just as in Alexandria we found ourselves in touch with a George Washington
      who was a flesh-and-blood Virginian as distinguished from the colorless
      paragon of the standard histories, so at Mount Vernon we meet the same
      Washington in his character of husband, farmer, and host. Even here,
      however, we are not wholly beyond the penumbra of fiction; for only five<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_246" id="page_246"></a>{246}</span> miles
      away is the town of Pohick, once the parish seat of Parson Weems, the
      inventor of the cherry-tree myth on which my generation were industriously
      fed. Although, of course, no one still living in the region can remember
      Washington, there are not a few who are familiar with the details of his
      daily life, handed down in their families from ancestors who did remember
      him. These make him out a very human country gentleman, who loved to ride,
      to shoot, to fence, and to wrestle; who mixed business with pleasure in an
      occasional horse-race or real estate speculation; who disbelieved in
      slavery, and was recognized by his own two hundred bondmen as a kind
      master, yet was noted for getting more work out of a negro than any other
      slaveholder in Virginia, and for not hesitating to administer corporal
      punishment to one who deserved it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We learn from these sources that he was “as straight as an Indian, and as
      free in his walk”; that he was what the ladies of that day, in spite of
      some marks left by the smallpox, styled “a pretty man”; that his weight of
      two hundred and ten pounds was all bone and muscle; and that he stood six
      feet and two inches tall in his shoes, which ranged in size from Number
      eleven to Number thirteen. His hands seem to have been his only physical
      deformity; they were so large<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_247"
      id="page_247"></a>{247}</span> as to attract attention and required gloves
      made expressly for them, three sizes larger than ordinary. His eyes are
      variously described as “blue,” as “of a bluish cast and very lively,” as
      “a cold, light gray,” and as “so gray that they looked almost white.”
      These alternatives may be reconciled, perhaps, by Gilbert Stuart’s
      recollection that his eyes were “a light grayish blue, deep sunken in
      their sockets, giving the expression of gravity of thought.” His hair was
      originally dark brown and fairly thick; his face was long, his nose
      prominent, his mouth large, and his chin firm. He suffered a good deal
      with toothache, particularly after his military service, and, as the rural
      remedy was the simplest known, he passed his last years almost toothless.
      This drove at least one portrait-painter into padding the front of his
      mouth with cotton wool, to make his lips look more natural than they did
      when drawn over the ill-fitting artificial teeth which he inserted for
      state occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great man lived well, his principal meal being a three o’clock dinner,
      which he washed down with five glasses of Madeira, taken with dessert.
      This allowance he gradually increased toward the close of his life till it
      reached two bottles. In sending away for sale a slave whom, though
      troublesome, he guaranteed as “exceedingly healthy, strong and good at<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_248" id="page_248"></a>{248}</span> the
      hoe,” he expressed his willingness to take in part payment “a hogshead of
      the best rum” and an indefinite quantity of “good old spirits.” In our
      gout-fearing era, these data have the ring of immoderate indulgence, but
      measured by the standards of the eighteenth century they were temperate
      enough. It must be said for the General, also, that he was charitable in
      his judgment of the weaknesses of others, as shown by his contract with an
      overseer, to whom he conceded the privilege of getting drunk for a week
      once a year; and his campaign expenses for election to the Virginia
      legislature embraced a hogshead and a barrel of punch, thirty-five gallons
      of wine, and forty-three gallons of strong cider.

      It makes us feel a little nearer to the Father of our Country to learn
      that he was not immune to the influence of bright eyes and dainty toilets;
      that he was in love, or fancied he was, with several different damsels at
      as many different times; and that his self-surrender occasionally declared
      itself in amatory verse too dreadful for belief. His most serious
      infatuation seems to have been with a Miss Gary, whom he courted
      fervently, only to be dismissed by her father with the sordid reminder:
      “My daughter, sir, has been accustomed to ride in her own coach!” As this
      was a knock-down argument for a stripling surveyor who<span class="pagenum"><a

      was just struggling to raise his professional terms to twenty-five dollars

      Martha Custis, who resembled Miss Cary almost as a twin sister.

      Of Mary Washington, mother of George, we get glimpses in the familiar chat
      of the vicinage. She appears as a rather difficult person, who tried the
      methodical soul of her son by her thriftless habits and her incessant
      complaints of being out of money. For years he did his utmost to induce
      her to rent her plantation further down the State, hire out her slaves,
      and live on her fixed income thus obtained, but to no purpose. Yet after
      he had become so famous that he was obliged to entertain at Mount Vernon
      all the traveling celebrities of two hemispheres, she suddenly took it
      into her head that she would like to come and live with him. In spite of
      his filial piety, candor compelled him to show her the impracticability of
      her proposal; and, though he tried to soften her disappointment by sending
      her the last seventy-five dollars in his purse, she seems to have
      continued dissatisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      George was not stingy. On the contrary, on each of three plantations which
      he farmed he kept one crib of corn always set apart for free distribution
      among the poor, and never let this fail, even if he had to rob<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_250" id="page_250"></a>{250}</span> his own
      table supply or to buy corn at a dollar a bushel to make up a deficit. He
      was not a rich man, but for sentimental reasons held on to Mount Vernon
      after it had ceased to be profitable property. At his death, he was worth
      only about seventy-five thousand dollars in his own right, and, had he
      lived ten years longer at the same rate, he would have died a bankrupt. It
      was his wife’s better investments that kept up the expenses of their home.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we go over the old mansion, we are shown the various rooms associated
      with Washington’s activities, and that in which his death occurred.
      Notwithstanding his sturdy muscular development, his throat and chest were
      always weak spots; and in 1799, after a soaking and chill from a ride
      through a December storm, he went to bed with a cold which left him unable
      to swallow. Soon he realized that the end was not far off. It was
      characteristic of the man that he should then discharge the doctors from
      further useless ministrations, give such directions about his burial as he
      deemed important, and calmly proceed to watch the waning of his own pulse.
      After a little the hand that held his wrist relaxed and dropped upon the
      coverlet, and the friends gathered in the chamber knew that all was over.

    <p>
      On the Maryland side of the Potomac, the suburb<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_251" id="page_251"></a>{251}</span> most convenient of access
      is Georgetown. In fact, it long ago ceased to be strictly a suburb, by
      incorporation with the city of Washington, from which it was separated
      only by Rock Creek, a narrow tributary of the Potomac. Officially, it is
      now West Washington, and its streets have been renamed and renumbered so
      as to conform as nearly as practicable to the system in use in the
      capital. All the same, Georgetown has never lost its identity. It had a
      life of its own before Washington was thought of; and within my
      recollection the old society of Georgetown used to look askance at the
      “new people” with whom Washington was filling up. It is still sprinkled
      with hoary houses set in quaint ancestral gardens, though modernism has
      touched the place at so many points that we can get a glimpse of these
      survivals sometimes only through deep vistas lined with the red brick
      side-walls of urban blocks. The most attractive of the old mansions, and
      the best preserved, is the Tudor house, built by Doctor William Thornton
      about 1810. It is a good specimen from the Georgian epoch in architecture,
      standing fitly in the midst of a great square of lawn, with shade trees
      and box hedges to correspond; and one of its traditions is that pretty
      little Nellie Custis went there to her first ball, though&mdash;but I
      leave others to struggle with the problem of conflicting dates. One<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_252" id="page_252"></a>{252}</span> thing we
      do know, that the place has always been in the possession of kinsfolk of
      the Mount Vernon family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many amusing stories are told of Georgetown’s early days, when the Scotch
      element were so strong in its population that a man could not be appointed
      to the office of flour inspector without subscribing to a test oath
      declaring his disbelief in the doctrine of “transsubstantiation in the
      sacrament of the Lord’s supper”; when the city fathers sought to save the
      expense of employing a surveyor to calculate the width of the Potomac at a
      point where a bridge was to be built, by ordering out all good citizens to
      pull at the opposite ends of a measuring-rope; and when the big triangle
      which was pounded as an alarm of fire fell from the belfry in which it
      hung, and fire-alarms were sounded thereafter by blowing a fish-horn
      through the streets. But none of these tales will have an interest for
      most visitors equal to the local version of the origin of the
      “Star-Spangled Banner.” For Georgetown was Francis Scott Key’s old home.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the story goes, part of the British forces which marched upon
      Washington in the summer of 1814 passed through Upper Marlboro, Maryland,
      on a day when Doctor William Beanes, a prominent physician, was
      entertaining several friends at dinner. As the gentlemen talked, they grew
      more and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_253" id="page_253"></a>{253}</span>
      indignant against the invaders, and, news being brought to them at table
      that a few red-coated stragglers were still in town committing
      depredations after the main body of their comrades had passed on, some one
      suggested that the party go out and arrest these men as disturbers of the
      peace. This was done, but to little effect; for as soon as the stragglers
      got away, they hastened to catch up with the army and lodge a complaint
      with their officers, who at once sent back a squad of soldiers to arrest
      the arresters. Three of the dining party, including Beanes, were carried
      off to Admiral Cockburn’s flagship, which was lying in the Patuxent River.
      Cockburn, after administering a disciplinary lecture to the trio,
      dismissed the others but took Beanes as a prisoner on his ship to
      Baltimore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key, who was Beanes’s nephew, hastened to Baltimore as soon as he heard of
      the doctor’s plight, and under a flag of truce went aboard the vessel to
      intercede with Cockburn for his uncle’s release. His plea was vain; and
      Cockburn would not even let him go ashore again till after the bombardment
      of Fort McHenry. When Key returned to Georgetown, he related his
      adventures at the next meeting of the local glee-club, and his fellow
      members urged him to put his narrative into verse. He read his production<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_254" id="page_254"></a>{254}</span> at a
      later meeting, and the club introduced it to the public, who adopted it as
      the national anthem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the noted names associated with Georgetown, outside of political
      life, may be mentioned those of Joel Benton, the poet and essayist, who
      bought a farm on the Washington side of Rock Creek, since famous as the
      Kalorama estate; Robert Fulton, the pioneer in steam navigation, who made
      some of his early experiments with water-craft and submarine explosives on
      the small streams of the neighborhood; George Peabody, financier and
      philanthropist, who came as a poor boy from Massachusetts and worked as a
      clerk in a store in Bridge Street; William W. Corcoran, whose later career
      somewhat resembled Peabody’s, and whose real start in life dated from the
      failure of a little shop he kept in the heart of the town; and, last but
      not least, a youthful belle whose romance demands a paragraph or two of
      its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baron Bodisco, Russian Minister to the United States during the Van Buren
      administration, lived, as did most of the foreign envoys of that time, in
      Georgetown. He was a bachelor, well on toward sixty years of age,
      uncompromisingly ugly, with a face covered with wrinkles, and a bald head
      which he tried to conceal under a somewhat obtrusive wig. He had for
      visitors one winter two young nephews,<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_255" id="page_255"></a>{255}</span> for whom he gave a dancing
      party at the legation, inviting all the socially eligible boys and girls
      in town. By some accident, one of his invitations miscarried and failed to
      reach Harriet Beall Williams, a most attractive and popular schoolgirl of
      sixteen. He hastened to repair his error as soon as he discovered it, and
      on the evening of the party hunted her up to make his apologies in person.
      It was a case of love at first sight. After that he contrived to meet her
      occasionally on her way to or from school, and ere long he became an
      avowed suitor for her hand. The courtship, though not displeasing to the
      girl, was for some time discouraged by her family. Finding her resolved to
      accept her elderly lover, however, they withdrew their active opposition,
      and Beauty and the Beast, as they were commonly called, were married in
      June.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron, who had excellent taste in everything except his own make-up,
      superintended all the details of the affair, even to the costumes of the
      bridal party. The bridesmaids were schoolmates of Miss Williams, one being
      Jessie Benton, then aged fourteen, who afterward became the wife of
      General John C. Fremont. The groomsmen were generally contemporaries of
      the groom, so that the note of age disparity was uniform throughout.
      President<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_256" id="page_256"></a>{256}</span>
      Van Buren and Henry Clay were conspicuous among the guests. At the first
      opportunity, the Baron took his bride to Russia and presented her at
      court, where she electrified the assembled nobility by shaking the Czar’s
      hand in cordial American fashion. It delighted the Czar, however, which
      was more to the point; and, although she did many unusual things, like
      declining the Czarina’s invitation to a Sunday function because she had
      been brought up to “keep the Sabbath,” she became a great favorite in the
      inner imperial circle, and loved to dwell on her foreign experiences after
      she came back to Georgetown to live. The Bodisco house is still pointed
      out to strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not all the historic associations of Georgetown and its neighborhood have
      been so peaceful. For a few miles out of town the river’s edge is dotted
      with sequestered nooks to which hot-brained gentlemen could retire on
      occasion, to wipe out their grievances in one another’s blood. The Little
      Falls bridge afforded such a retreat to Henry Clay and John Randolph after
      Randolph’s speech declaring that the “alphabet that writes the name of
      Thersites, of blackguard, of squalidity, refuses her letters for” Clay.
      The combatants took the precaution to cross the bridge far enough to avoid
      the jurisdiction of the District authorities.<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_257" id="page_257"></a>{257}</span> Clay’s first shot cut
      Randolph’s coat near the hip, Randolph’s did nothing. At the second word,
      Clay’s bullet went wild, and Randolph deliberately sent his into the air,
      remarking: “I do not fire at you, Mr. Clay!” At the same time he advanced
      with hand outstretched, Clay meeting him halfway. Randolph, as they were
      leaving the field, pointed to the hole made by Clay’s first bullet, saying
      jocosely: “You owe me a coat, Mr. Clay.” “I am glad, sir,” answered Clay,
      “that the debt is no greater.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject of duels calls to mind another suburb, to wit, Bladensburg,
      Maryland, where the defenders of Washington made their brief and
      ineffectual stand against the invading British in 1814. Here, for sixty
      years, in a green little dell about a mile out of town, all sorts of
      personal and political feuds were settled with deadly weapons. The most
      celebrated of these meetings was that of March 22, 1820, between two
      Commodores of the American navy, Stephen Decatur and James Barren. Like
      most duels, it was more the work of mischief-makers than of the principals
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Decatur was at the height of his fame for achievements in the War of 1812
      and against the Barbary pirates; he was a fine marksman with the pistol,
      and had had several earlier experiences on the dueling<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_258" id="page_258"></a>{258}</span>-field. Barren, on the other
      hand, was under a cloud for some professional mistakes; he was six years
      Decatur’s senior, had no taste for dueling, and was near-sighted. Down to
      the last, Barron was plainly disposed to accept any reasonable concession
      and call the affair off; but Decatur was in high spirits and full of
      confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two shots rang out simultaneously, and both men fell. Decatur, who was at
      first supposed to be dead, presently showed signs of returning animation
      and was lifted to his feet, only to stagger a few paces toward his
      antagonist and fall again. As the two men lay side by side, Barron turned
      his face to say to Decatur that he hoped, when they met in another world,
      they would be better friends than in this. Decatur responded that he had
      never been Barren’s enemy, and, though he cherished no animosity to Barron
      for killing him, he found it harder to forgive the men who had goaded them
      into this quarrel. Both combatants were carried back to Washington, where
      Barron slowly recovered from his wound; but Decatur, after a day of
      intense suffering, died in the house which still bears his name, at the
      corner of Jackson Place and H Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      So habitually was this one ravine chosen for the settlement of affairs of
      honor that when two Representatives,<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_259" id="page_259"></a>{259}</span> Jonathan Cilley of Maine
      and William J. Graves of Kentucky, decided in 1838 to end a dispute with
      rifles, they outwitted pursuit by choosing for their fight the eastern end
      of the Anacostia bridge on the high-road to Marlboro, Maryland; and a
      posse who started out to stop them went to the accustomed ground only to
      find it empty. This duel had naught of the dramatic quality of that
      between Decatur and Barren, but its effect on the public mind proved more
      far-reaching. Cilley was a young man of brilliant promise, highly
      respected as well as popular, with a wife and three little children. The
      quarrel was forced upon him because, in the interest of the proper dignity
      of Congress, he objected to a proposed investigation by the House of some
      vague and irresponsible insinuations made in a recent newspaper letter
      against sundry members who were not named or otherwise identified. Graves
      insisted that this speech was an insult to the author of the article,
      whose championship he gratuitously undertook.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first two shots were thrown away on both sides. At the third fire,
      Cilley fell upon his face, his adversary’s bullet having killed him
      instantly. When the news of his death spread through Washington,
      indignation against Graves rose to fever heat, and his public career ended
      with that hour. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_260" id="page_260"></a>{260}</span>
      wantonness of such a sacrifice of a useful life, where the writer who
      figured as the cause of the quarrel did not even take a part in it, gave
      special point to the condemnation of the false standard of honor set up by
      the “code.” The funeral services for Cilley at the Capitol were attended
      by the President and Cabinet, in testimony to the high esteem in which he
      had universally been held; while the Supreme Court declined its invitation
      in a body, as the most emphatic means of expressing its abhorrence of
      glossing murder with a thin coat of etiquette. Ministers, not only in
      Washington but in all the more highly civilized parts of the country,
      denounced dueling from the pulpit, newspapers published editorials and
      associations adopted resolutions against it, additional legislation for
      the abolition of the practice was introduced in various legislatures, and
      Congress passed an act to punish, with a term in the penitentiary, the
      sending or acceptance of a challenge in the District of Columbia.<span

      <span class="letra">A</span>MONG the projects in the minds of the founders
      of the federal city was a monument to celebrate the success of the
      American Revolution. George Washington personally selected the site for
      it, due south of the center of the President’s House. Meanwhile the
      Continental Congress had recommended the erection of an equestrian statue
      of General Washington, and, immediately after his death, the Congress then
      in session resolved to rear a monument under which his body should be
      entombed. But, though resolutions were cheap, monuments were costly, and
      the project gradually faded out of mind till revived in 1816 by a member
      of Congress from South Carolina. Still nothing happened, till another
      generation devised a plan for raising the money by popular subscription
      without waiting longer for a Government appropriation. The Washington
      Monument Society was organized with a membership fee of one dollar, so as
      to give every American opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_262"
      id="page_262"></a>{262}</span> to subscribe. By 1848 a sufficient fund had
      been collected to spur Congress into presenting a site; and the spot
      chosen was that marked by Washington for the monument to the Revolution,
      thus happily combining his plan with the nation’s tribute to himself.
      Tests of the ground showed that, in order to get a safe footing, it would
      be necessary to move a little further to the eastward, which accounts for
      the present monument’s being not quite on the short axis of the White
      House.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the original plan of a statue, an obelisk of granite and marble was
      substituted, which by its simplicity of lines, its towering height, and
      its purity of color, should symbolize the exceptional character and
      services of the foremost American. The building fund held out pretty well
      till a politico-religious quarrel arose over the acceptance, for
      incorporation in the monument, of a fine block of African marble sent by
      the Pope; and on Washington’s birthday, 1855, a Know-Nothing mob descended
      upon the headquarters of the Society, seized its books and papers, and
      took forcible possession of the monument. The Know-Nothing party ended its
      political existence three years later, and the monument went back to its
      former custodians; but the riotous demonstration had checked the orderly
      progress of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_263" id="page_263"></a>{263}</span>
      work, and, as the Civil War was imminent, the shaft, then one hundred
      seventy-eight feet high, was roofed over to await the return of normal
      conditions. It was not till 1876 that, under the patriotic impetus of the
      centenary, Congress was induced to coöperate. The work was vigorously
      pushed from 1880 to 1884; and in the spring of 1885, when it had attained
      a height of five hundred fifty-five feet and five and five-tenths inches,
      occurred the formal dedication of the Washington National Monument as we
      see it to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the benefit of any one whose pleasure in a masterpiece is measured
      with a plummet, it may be noted that the Monument falls less than fifty
      feet short of the Tower of Babel; to him who revels in terms of distance,
      the glistening pile will appeal on the ground that it is visible from a
      crest of the Blue Ridge Mountains, more than forty miles away as the bee
      flies. But most of its neighbors in Washington find it for other reasons
      an unceasing joy. To us it is more truly at the heart of things than even
      the Capitol. It is the hoary sentinel at our water-gate; or, spread the
      city out like a fan, and the Monument is the pivot which holds the frame
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitor who has seen it once has just begun to see it. A smooth-faced
      obelisk, devoid of ornament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_264"
      id="page_264"></a>{264}</span> it would appear the stolidest object in the
      landscape; in truth, it is as versatile as the clouds. Every change in
      your position reveals it in a new phase. Go close to it and look up, and
      its walls seem to rise infinitely and dissolve into the atmosphere; stand
      on the neighboring hills, and you are tempted to throw a stone over its
      top; sail down the Potomac, and the slender white shaft is still sending
      its farewells after you when the city has passed out of sight. It plays
      chameleon to the weather. It may be gay one moment and grave the next,
      like the world. Sometimes, in the varying lights, it loses its perspective
      and becomes merely a flat blade struck against space; an hour later, every
      line and seam is marked with the crispness of chiseled sculpture. On a
      fair morning, it is radiant under the first beams of the rising sun; in
      the full of the moon, it is like a thing from another world&mdash;cold,
      shimmering, unreal. Often in the spring and fall its peak is lost in
      vapor, and the shaft looks as if it were a tall, thin Ossa penetrating the
      home of the gods. Again, with its base wrapped in fog and its summit in
      cloud, it is a symbol of human destiny, emerging from one mystery only to
      pass into another. Always the same, yet never twice alike, it is to the
      old Washingtonian a being instinct with life, a personality to be known
      and loved. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_265" id="page_265"></a>{265}</span>
      has relatively little to tell the passing stranger, but many confidences
      for the friend of years.
    </p>
    <p>
      To realize all that it is to us, you must see it on a changeable day. Come
      with me then to the Capitol, whence, from an outlook on the western
      terrace, we face a thick and troubled sky. The air is murky. Clouds
      fringed with gray fleece, which have been hanging so low as to hide the
      apex of the Monument, are folding back upon themselves in the southern
      heavens, forming a rampart dark and forbidding. Against this the obelisk
      is projected, having caught and held one ray of pure sunshine which has
      found an opening and shot through like a searchlight. It is plain that an
      atmospheric battle is at hand. The garrulous city seems struck dumb; the
      timid trees are shivering with apprehension; the voice of the wind is half
      sob and half warning. The search-ray vanishes as the door of the cloud
      fort is closed and the rumbling of the bolts is heard behind it. The
      landscape in the background is blotted from view by eddies of yellow dust,
      as if a myriad of horsemen were making a tentative charge. Silent and
      unmoved, the obelisk stands there, a white warrior bidding defiance to the
      forces of sky and earth. As the subsiding dust marks the retreat of the
      cavalry, the artillery opens fire. First one masked porthole<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_266" id="page_266"></a>{266}</span> and then
      another belches flame, but the sharp crash or dull roar which follows
      passes quite unnoticed by the champion. Then comes the rattle of musketry,
      as a sheet of hail sweeps across the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are not watching a combat, only an assault, for these demonstrations
      call forth no response. On the champion&mdash;taking everything, giving
      nothing&mdash;the only effect they produce is a change of color from snowy
      white to ashen gray. Even that is but for a moment. As the storm of hail
      melts into a shower of limpid raindrops to which the relieved trees open
      their palms, the wind ceases its wailing, and the wall of cloud falls
      apart to let the sun’s rays through once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Monument is, of course, only one of many memorials to great men in
      Washington. We have heroes and philanthropists, poets and physicians,
      soldiers and men of science, mounted and afoot, standing and sitting. We
      have horses in every posture that will hold a rider: Jackson’s balanced on
      its hind legs like the toy charger on the nursery mantelpiece;
      Washington’s getting ready to try the same trick; Sheridan’s dashing along
      the line to the lilt of Buchanan Read’s poem; Pulaski’s, Greene’s and
      McPherson’s, Hancock’s and McClellan’s and Logan’s, walking calmly over
      the field; Scott’s and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_267"
      id="page_267"></a>{267}</span> Sherman’s watching the parade. The best
      equestrian statue is that of General George H. Thomas, by Quincy Ward, at
      the junction of Massachusetts Avenue with Fourteenth Street. Here we have
      the acme of art in treating such a subject: spirit coupled with repose.
      The horse has been moving, but has been checked by the rider to give him a
      chance to look about; they could go on the next moment if need be, or they
      could stand indefinitely just as they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scott statue, at Massachusetts Avenue and Sixteenth Street, is good if
      we take it apart and examine it piecemeal; but the massive rider threatens
      to break down his slender-limbed steed, which is, by some mischance, of
      the mare’s build and not the stallion’s. General Sheridan, who used to
      live within a stone’s throw of this statue, lay while ill in a bedroom
      commanding a view of it. “I hope,” he remarked one day, “that if a
      grateful country ever commemorates me in bronze, it will give me a better
      mount than old Scott’s!” It is hard to find anything new to do with a
      general officer and a horse without putting them into some impossible
      attitude. A sculptor who attempts a reasonable innovation is liable to be
      snubbed for it, as one was not long ago when he offered in competition a
      statue of General<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_268" id="page_268"></a>{268}</span>
      Grant, dismounted, with his bridle swung over one of his arms while he
      used the other hand to hold his field-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the best-known statues in the city have attracted as much
      attention by their travels as by their artistic qualities. One of these is
      Greenough’s colossal marble presentment of George Washington, which
      visitors to the Capitol ten years ago will recall as standing in the open
      space facing the main east portico. Greenough was in Italy in 1835, when
      it was ordered, and spent eight years on its production. It shows
      Washington seated, nude to the waist, and below that draped in a flowing
      robe. It weighed, when finished, twelve tons without a pedestal, and
      required twenty-two yoke of oxen to haul from Florence to Genoa. Peasants
      who saw it on the way took it for the image of some mighty saint, and
      dropped upon their knees and crossed themselves as it passed. The
      man-of-war which was waiting for it at Genoa had no hatchway large enough
      to take it in, so a merchant vessel had to be chartered for its voyage to
      America. Arrived at the Capitol, where it was intended to stand in the
      center of the rotunda, it could not be squeezed through the doors, and the
      masonry had to be cut away. Then it was discovered that it was causing the
      floor to settle, and a lot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_269"
      id="page_269"></a>{269}</span> shoring had to be done in the crypt
      underneath. Finally, as it was not suited to its place, the masonry around
      the doorway was ripped out again, and the statue was set up in the plaza,
      where it remained till 1908, the sport of rains and frosts and
      souvenir-maniacs, when it took what every one hopes will be its last
      journey&mdash;to the National Museum. The original purpose of Congress was
      to have a “pedestrian statue” costing, all told, five thousand dollars.
      What has eventuated is Washington’s head set on a torso of Jupiter Tonans,
      costing, with all its traveling expenses, more than fifty thousand
      dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another peregrinating statue is that of Thomas Jefferson, which stands
      to-day against the east wall of the rotunda. In 1833 it occupied the
      center of this room. When Greenough’s Washington was brought in, Jefferson
      was removed to the Library of Congress, which was then housed in the rooms
      of the west front of the Capitol. In 1850 it was carried up to the White
      House and planted in the middle of the north garden. It held that site for
      twenty-four years and then came back to the rotunda, from which there is
      no reason to think it will be moved again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only parallel to these instances of frequent shifts in the local art
      world is the case of a painting entitled “Love and Life,” presented by the
      English<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_270" id="page_270"></a>{270}</span>
      artist, George F. Watts, to our Government. Mr. Cleveland, who was
      President at the time, hung it in the White House, but the prudish
      comments passed upon it by visitors led to its transfer to the Corcoran
      Gallery of Art. In the Roosevelt administration it made three trips, first
      to the White House, then back to the Corcoran Gallery, and then to the
      White House again, where it rested till President Taft came in, only to be
      rebanished to the Corcoran Gallery. President Wilson had it returned to
      the White House, and there it is at the present writing.
    </p>

      Although there has never been in Washington a definite scheme for the
      location of statues, which have been planted, hit or miss, wherever space
      offered, accident has arranged a few of them so as to form a rather
      remarkable historical series. Starting with the Washington National
      Monument, in honor of the foremost figure in the Revolution and the
      President who set in motion the machinery of the embryo republic, we pass
      directly northward to the White House, home of all his successors in the
      Presidency and emblematic of the civil government which emerged from the
      War for Independence. A few hundred feet further northward stands the
      statue of Andrew Jackson, the hero of the War of 1812, the first fought by
      the United States as a nation. About<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_271" id="page_271"></a>{271}</span> a half-mile more to the
      north we reach the statue of Winfield Scott, the general whose capture of
      Mexico City ended the second foreign war in which the nation engaged. All
      that is needed to complete this remarkable procession is a memorial arch
      on Sixteenth Street heights, to the soldiers and sailors on both sides of
      the Civil War which cemented the Union begun under Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange to say, the city which best knew Lincoln and Grant has had, up to
      this time, no out-of-doors statue whatever of Grant and no adequate one of
      Lincoln. In Lincoln Park, about a mile east of the Capitol, is the
      Emancipation statue, and in front of the City Hall there is an
      insignificant standing figure of Lincoln, perched on a pillar so high that
      the features can be seen only dimly. A statue of Grant will later occupy
      the central pedestal of a group in the little park at the foot of the
      western slope of the Capitol grounds, which it is proposed to call Union
      Square. On either side of Grant, the plan originally was to place Sherman
      and Sheridan; but as the Sherman and Sheridan statues already set up
      elsewhere are so diverse in character, it has been questioned whether they
      would fit into the Union Square group. After many suggestions,
      controversies, and reports, Congress decided, a year or<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_272" id="page_272"></a>{272}</span> two ago,
      upon a form of memorial for Lincoln, which is already under way. It will
      be a marble temple, designed by Henry Bacon, in Potomac Park, with a
      statue of the War President, by Daniel Chester French, visible in the
      recesses of its dignified colonnade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the scores of statues and miles of painted portraits which keep
      vivid the memory of great and good men who are gone, Washington has many
      institutions and buildings with personal associations that fulfil a
      similar purpose. The Corcoran Gallery of Art, for instance, was the gift
      of the late William W. Corcoran, the financier. The national deaf-mute
      college at Kendall Green, on the northeastern edge of the city, recalls
      its original benefactor, Amos Kendall, who was Postmaster-general under
      Jackson, as well as the work of Doctor Edward M. Gallaudet in raising it
      from its modest beginnings to its present eminence. The Pension Office, in
      which eight inaugural balls have been held, takes first rank among our
      public edifices for architectural ugliness. It is nevertheless an honor to
      the memory of Quartermaster-general Meigs, who asked the privilege of
      proving, in an era of extravagance, that a suitable building could be
      reared for the money allotted to it, and who turned back into the treasury
      a large slice of his appropriation after having paid every<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_273" id="page_273"></a>{273}</span> bill.
      The present Library of Congress is, in a like manner, a monument to the
      late Bernard R. Green, whose engineering skill and administrative faculty
      performed a feat corresponding to General Meigs’s; it reminds us, also, of
      Thomas Jefferson, whose private library, purchased after the burning of
      the Capitol, formed the nucleus of the present magnificent collection. The
      Soldiers’ Home, near the north boundary of the city, commemorates General
      Scott’s success in Mexico, the tribute he exacted there for a breach of
      truce being used in founding this beautiful retreat, where veterans of the
      regular army may pass their declining years in comfort.

      Few people, probably, are aware that the Smithsonian Institution, whose
      fame is as wide as civilization, owes its origin to the rejection of a
      manuscript prepared for publication. James Smithson, an Englishman of
      means, who had been a frequent contributor to the Philosophical
      Transactions of the Royal Society of London, sent in, a little less than a
      century ago, a paper which the censors refused to print; and its author
      avenged the affront by altering his will, in which he had bequeathed his
      entire fortune to the Society, so as to throw the reversion to the United
      States, a country he had never seen, to be used for “an establishment for
      the increase and diffusion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_274"
      id="page_274"></a>{274}</span> knowledge among men.” Congress had a long
      quibble about the disposal of the money, but at last hit upon a plan, and
      since then has turned over much of the public scientific research work to
      be performed “under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution.” The
      accumulation of trophies of exploration, historical relics, and gifts of
      objects of art and industry from foreign potentates, presently overflowed
      the accommodations of the Institution proper, and a National Museum was
      built to house these treasures. The Smithsonian commemorates not only the
      beneficence of Smithson, but the great achievements of its several
      executive heads, like Joseph Henry’s in electromagnetism, Spencer F.
      Baird’s in the culture of fish as a source of food-supply, and Samuel P.
      Langley’s in aërial navigation and the standardization of time.

      The old City Hall, better known now as the District Court House, will be
      remembered as the place where the first President Harrison probably caught
      the cold which resulted in his death. It has a tragic association with
      another President, also, for in one of its court-rooms was conducted the
      trial of Guiteau for assassinating James A. Garfield. This trial excited
      vigorous comment throughout the country by what seemed to many critics an
      unwarrantable latitude allowed the defendant for self-exploitation.<span

      Judge Walter T. Cox, who presided, was one of the ablest and most
      conscientious jurists who ever sat on the Supreme bench of the District.
      From personal attendance on the trial, I feel sure that the course pursued
      by him was the only one which could have given the jury a sure ground for
      dooming the assassin to death; and it was doubtless a realization of that
      fact which held in check the mob spirit that began to show itself at one
      stage and threatened to save the Government the trouble of putting up a
      gallows. The popular rancor against Guiteau was so strong that in order to
      get him safely into the Court House from the “black Maria” which brought
      him from the jail every morning, and to reverse the operation at the close
      of every day’s session, the vehicle was backed up within about twenty feet
      of one of the basement doors, and a double file of police, standing
      shoulder to shoulder with clubs drawn, made a narrow little lane through
      which he was rushed at a quickstep, his face blanched with terror, and his
      furtive eyes fixed on the earth.

      Another historical incident is associated with the old building, to which
      many attribute the final resolve of President Lincoln to issue his
      Emancipation Proclamation. I refer to the abolition of slavery in the
      District of Columbia. A bill to this end, introduced<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page_276" id="page_276"></a>{276}</span> by Henry Wilson in
      December, 1861, was hotly debated in Congress but finally passed, and was
      signed on April 16, 1862. Only loyal owners were to be paid for their
      slaves, and every applicant for compensation had to take an iron-clad oath
      of allegiance to the Government. The whole business was handled by a board
      of three commissioners, who employed for their assistance an experienced
      slave-dealer imported from Baltimore. They met in one of the court-rooms,
      and the dealer put the negroes through their paces just as he had been
      accustomed to in the heyday of his trade, making them dance to show their
      suppleness and bite various tough substances as a test of the soundness of
      their teeth. Many of the black men and women came into the room singing
      hosannas to glorify the dawn of freedom. The highest appraisement of any
      slave was seven hundred and eighty-eight dollars for a good blacksmith;
      the lowest was ten dollars and ninety-five cents for a baby. These were
      about half the prices which would have been brought but for the fact that
      only one million dollars was appropriated, whereas the total estimated
      value of the slaves paid for was nearer two million, and all payments had
      to be scaled accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A remarkable feature of this episode was the discovery <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_277" id="page_277"></a>{277}</span>of how
      many slaveholders there were who were not white people. Now and then in
      the past, when for some special reason a negro had been freed, he would
      save his earnings till he had accumulated enough to buy his wife and
      children, who still remained in bondage to him till he saw fit to manumit
      them. One case which attracted wide attention was that of a woman who had
      bought her husband, a graceless scamp who proceeded to celebrate his good
      fortune by becoming an incorrigible drunkard. This had so outraged the
      feelings of his wife that she had finally sold him to a dealer who was
      picking up a boatload of cheap slaves to carry south. From that hour she
      had lost sight of him; but she haunted the commissioners’ sessions from
      day to day in the hope that the Government, now that it was going into the
      slave-buying business, might give her a little addition to the bargain
      price at which she had sold the old man.

      Judiciary Square, in which the Court House and the Pension Office stand,
      was, when Chief Justice Taney lived in Indiana Avenue, a neighborhood of
      consequence. Several of the older buildings thereabout exhale a flavor of
      fifty or sixty years ago, and tradition connects them with such personages
      as Rufus Choate, Caleb Cushing, Thomas H. Benton, Stephen A. Douglas, John

      Opposite the east park of the Capitol, as we have already seen, stands the
      Old Capitol, a building with a variegated history. It was erected for the
      accommodation of Congress after the burning of the Capitol by the British.
      In it Henry Clay passed some years of his Speakership, and till very
      lately there was a scar on the wall of one of the rooms which was said to
      have been made by his desk. Under its roof the first Senators from
      Indiana, Illinois, and Mississippi took their seats. In front of it,
      President Monroe was inaugurated. After Congress left it to return to the
      restored Capitol, it was rented for a boarding-house, patronized chiefly
      by Senators and Representatives. Here John C. Calhoun lived for some time,
      and here he died. In one of the rooms, Persico, the Italian sculptor,
      worked out the model of his “Discoverer.” In another, Ann Royall edited
      her <i>Huntress</i>.

      After the Civil War broke out, the Old Capitol was turned into a jail for
      the confinement of military offenders who were awaiting trial by
      court-martial, and for Confederate spies and other persons accused of
      unlawfully giving aid and comfort to the enemy. Belle Boyd, who was locked
      up there for a while, has left us her impressions of the place as “a vast
      brick building, like all prisons, somber, chilling, and repulsive.<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_279" id="page_279"></a>{279}</span>” She
      describes William P. Wood, who was superintendent of the prison, as
      “having a humane heart beneath a rough exterior.” Every Sunday he used to
      provide facilities for religious worship to his compulsory guests,
      announcing the hours and forms in characteristic fashion: “All you who
      want to hear the word of God preached according to Jeff Davis, go down
      into the yard; and all of you who want to hear it preached according to
      Abe Lincoln, go into No. 16.” In the jail yard Henry Wirz, who had been
      the keeper of the Confederate military prison at Andersonville, Georgia,
      where so many Union soldiers died of starvation and disease, was hanged
      for murder. At the close of the war the building was divided into a block
      of dwellings, of which the southernmost was long the home of the late
      Justice Field of the Supreme Court. The Justice used to enjoy telling his
      visitors about the distinguished men from the South who, after dining at
      his table, had roamed over the premises and located their one-time places
      of confinement.

      The oldest house of worship in Washington is St. Paul’s, a spireless
      Protestant Episcopal church not far from the Soldiers’ Home. It stands
      well toward the rear of the Rock Creek Cemetery, which also contains the
      world-famous bronze by St. Gaudens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_280"
      id="page_280"></a>{280}</span> in the Adams lot. This is a seated female
      figure, in flowing classic drapery, to which no one has ventured to attach
      a permanent title, though it has been variously known as “Grief” and “The
      Peace of God.” St. Paul’s goes back to the colonial era and was built of
      brick imported from England. A younger church, nevertheless numbered among
      the oldest relics of its class within the city proper, is St. John’s, at
      the corner of Sixteenth and H streets. It was designed by Latrobe about
      the time he undertook the restoration of the Capitol and was consecrated
      in 1816. It has long been called “the President’s church” because so many
      tenants of the White House, just across Lafayette Square, have worshiped
      in it.

      Madison and Monroe were the first, and the vestry soon set apart one pew
      to be preserved always for the free use of the reigning Presidential
      family. John Quincy Adams was a Unitarian, but came to the afternoon
      services; and Jackson, though a Methodist, was frequently to be seen
      there. Van Buren was a constant attendant both as Vice-president and as
      President. William Henry Harrison, for the month he lived in Washington,
      came regularly, regardless of the weather or his state of health; and he
      was to have been confirmed the very week he died. Tyler was a member of
      the congregation. Polk had other<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_281"
      id="page_281"></a>{281}</span> affiliations, but Taylor, Fillmore, and
      Buchanan used the President’s pew. Then came a break in the line till
      Arthur entered the White House; and his retirement appears to have been
      followed by another lapse in the succession till Mrs. Roosevelt revived
      it. Her husband used to accompany her from time to time, though he
      retained his active connection with the Reformed (Dutch) communion. Since
      the Roosevelts, the line has been broken again. John Quincy Adams became
      so fond of St. John’s that, when he returned to Washington as a
      Representative, he renewed his Sunday visits. He paid close attention to
      the preliminary service but seemed to sleep through the sermon, though he
      was usually able to repeat the next day, with considerable accuracy, the
      main things the minister had said.

      This whole neighborhood bristles with memories of great people. The old
      Tayloe mansion was styled, in its later years, “the Cream-white House,”
      partly because of its color, and partly in jocose reference to its
      occupancy by two or three Vice-presidents. The house on the corner north
      of it, now owned by the Cosmos Club, was the home of Dolly Madison in her
      widowhood. After her death it passed into the hands of Charles Wilkes, the
      gallant naval officer who was for many years the unrecognized discoverer<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page_282" id="page_282"></a>{282}</span> of the
      Antarctic continent, and who, in the early days of the Civil War, forcibly
      took two of his late Washington neighbors, Messrs. Mason and Slidell, off
      the British steamer <i>Trent</i>, which was conveying them to Europe on a
      diplomatic mission for the Confederate Government. South of the Tayloe
      house is the Belasco Theater, on the site of the old-fashioned red brick
      building in which occurred the attempted assassination of Secretary Seward
      and where James G. Blaine passed the last years of his life. On H Street,
      about a block to the eastward, General McClellan made his headquarters in
      the intervals between his commands of the Army of the Potomac; while in a
      near cluster are former homes of Commodore Decatur, John Quincy Adams,
      Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, Montgomery Blair, Gideon Welles, George
      Bancroft, and John Hay, as well as the house where the Ashburton treaty
      was negotiated and where Owen Meredith wrote his “Lucile.” Edward Everett,
      Jefferson Davis, and Tobias Lear lived, at various times, a short distance
      away.

      One of my favorite excursions about the city with friends who revere the
      memory of the War President is what I call my “Lincoln pilgrimage.” We
      start at the White House, turn eastward and take F Street to Tenth, and
      then southward a half-square. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_283"
      id="page_283"></a>{283}</span> brings us in front of the building which
      once was Ford’s Theater, by the route taken by Lincoln on the evening of
      Good Friday, 1865. Here are the arches which once opened into the theater
      lobby but are now used for ground-floor windows; through one of them he
      passed on his way to his box. Directly across the street is the house to
      which he was carried to die. In it is preserved the Oldroyd collection of
      Lincoln relics, a really remarkable array. After inspecting it, we return
      to F Street and go eastward again to about the middle of the block, where
      an alley emerges from a lower level south of us. Down into this we dive,
      and, making a sharp right-angle turn, find ourselves at the old stage-door
      of the theater, beside which Booth left his horse, and through which he
      made his dash for liberty after his mad deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back again up the alley we climb, through F Street to Ninth, through Ninth
      to H, and eastward on H Street to Number 604, the house of Mrs. Surratt,
      the rendezvous of the conspirators and the place where some of them were
      captured. It looks to-day very much as it did on the night of the
      assassination. Retracing our steps to Seventh Street, we board a
      southbound car, which carries us to the gate of the reservation now
      occupied by the Washington Barracks and the Army War College. Here, within
      a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_284" id="page_284"></a>{284}</span>
      few hundred feet of the entrance, used to stand the military prison where
      the conspirators were confined, and in the yard of which they paid the
      last penalty for their crime.

      And here, dear reader, we come to the end of our present walks and talks
      about Washington. As I warned you at the outset, I have treated our
      wanderings as a pleasure-jaunt rather than as a medium of solid
      instruction. When you find yourself thirsting for the severely practical,
      you can come back and make the round again, if you choose, in a
      sight-seeing car, and the megaphone-man will point out to you twice as
      many objects of interest and give you three times as much information
      about them&mdash;accurate or otherwise. He will take pains to show you all
      the Government buildings and the hotels, the foreign legations and the
      theaters, the millionaires’ houses, and parks and circles and statuary
      which I have dismissed with a line or left unmentioned. He will tell you
      how many tons every bronze weighs, how long every edifice took in
      building, and how large a fortune every Senator amassed before crowning
      his career with a tour of public service. I could have told you these
      things, too, but, rather than force too fast a gait upon you, I have left
      them<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_285" id="page_285"></a>{285}</span>
      for the megaphone-man and taken for my task some odds and ends he could
      not take for his. I should have liked to tell you how the Government swept
      all the electric wires out of the sky and hid them underground; how it
      drained the marshes on the city’s western edge, cleared the channels of
      the Potomac, and built out of the dredgings a big pleasure-ground; and how
      it got rid of the annual inundations, in one of which, just about a
      generation ago, I crossed the busiest part of Pennsylvania Avenue in a
      rowboat.
    </p>
    <p>
      These improvements, and others in the same category, have been paralleled
      by the changes in the architecture of the city, at the expense of tearing
      down something old to make room for whatever new was to go up. Touched by
      the spirit of progress, the face of Washington is rapidly becoming as
      destitute of landmarks as its origin is destitute of myths, and the artist
      who visits it in quest of the antique has a hunt before him. Nevertheless,
      it has not lost its picturesque appeal for the pencil guided by
      imagination, or its colorful legends for the memory seeking relief from
      more serious things.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
